# TGSpeechBox (TGSBRender, formerly nvspRender) generic output module for Speech Dispatcher
#
# This uses Speech Dispatcher's built-in "sd_generic" module: no C module code
# in Speech Dispatcher is required.
#
# Pipeline:
#   SSIP text ($DATA) -> espeak-ng (text -> IPA) -> tgsbRender (IPA -> raw PCM) -> aplay
#
# Notes:
# - tgsbRender (built from this repo) outputs raw 16-bit signed little-endian PCM
#   at 16000 Hz (configurable via --samplerate).
# - Edit the --packdir value below to point at the directory containing "packs/".
#
# DSP V5 Features (tgsbRender supports these via command line):
# - Voice profiles: --voice <name>
# - VoicingTone parameters: --speed-quotient, --voiced-tilt, etc.
# - FrameEx voice quality: --creakiness, --breathiness, --jitter, --shimmer, --sharpness
#
# References/examples:
# - Debian speech-dispatcher generic module configs show the expected variables
#   ($DATA, $LANGUAGE, $VOICE, $PITCH, $RATE, $VOLUME) and conversion knobs.
# - "piper" generic module configs commonly use aplay with --output-raw pipelines.

# Where to look for module logs (enabled via Debug 1): see speechd.conf.

# IMPORTANT:
# - "$DATA" is substituted by Speech Dispatcher.
# - The command must stop on SIGKILL.
#
# Update the paths if you install tgsbRender somewhere else.
#
# Note: $VOICE is passed to --voice for voice profile support (e.g. "Clara", "Adam").
# If the voice profile doesn't exist, tgsbRender falls back to the default voice.
