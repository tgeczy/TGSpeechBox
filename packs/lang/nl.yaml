normalization:
  preReplacements:
    # Dutch labiodental approximant ʋ - very characteristic
    # Map to /v/ as approximation (NVSP doesn't model ʋ separately yet)
    - from: "ʋ"
      to: "v"

    # Mnemonic fallback: Q -> ɣ (voiced velar fricative)
    - from: "Q"
      to: "ɣ"

    # Dutch g/ch are velar/uvular fricatives
    # Northern Dutch often merges voiced/voiceless to [x] or [χ]
    # Southern Dutch preserves the contrast
    # For standard, keep the voiceless form dominant
    - from: "ɣ"
      to: "x"

    # Dutch diphthongs - ensure proper handling
    # ij/ei = [ɛi], ui = [œy], ou/au = [ɔu]
    # These should already be in phonemes.yaml

    # Final devoicing is automatic in Dutch
    # Word-final b d g → p t k
    # This happens in speech, but IPA from eSpeak may already reflect it

  replacements:
    # Schwa elision - Dutch often drops final schwa after obstruents
    # But keep for TTS clarity

    # The -en ending often loses the n (just schwa remains)
    # e.g., "lopen" → [ˈloːpə(n)]
    # Keep n for clarity in TTS

intonation:
  # Dutch declaratives - moderate fall
