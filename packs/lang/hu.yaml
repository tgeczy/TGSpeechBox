# Hungarian language pack — Opus 4.6 revision
# Hungarian is SYLLABLE-TIMED with fixed initial stress, phonemic vowel length,
# and a rich palatal consonant inventory. Prosody is relatively flat with
# gentle final fall — quite different from English stress-timing.

settings:
  legacyPitchMode: espeak_style

  # === PITCH MODEL ===
  # Hungarian intonation: relatively flat phrase with gentle terminal fall.
  # Stress is word-initial but realized mainly as F0 prominence, not duration.
  # Fujisaki with low amplitudes captures this better than eSpeak's
  # English-centric stepped contours.

  # === STRESS ===
  # Hungarian stress is word-initial and very subtle — mainly pitch, not length.
  # A tiny durational cue is natural but must not distort short/long contrasts.
  primaryStressDiv: 1.05
  secondaryStressDiv: 1.00

  # === LENGTH CONTRAST ===
  # Hungarian has phonemic vowel length (a/á, e/é, i/í, etc.) — this MUST be
  # perceptually clear. The short/long distinction is the #1 prosodic feature.

  # === COARTICULATION ===
  # ENABLED at moderate strength. Real Hungarian speech has coarticulation —
  # turning it off entirely makes speech sound like isolated phoneme splicing.
  #
  # The ɡ/ɟ confusion near front vowels is fixed by:
  #   - Disabling velar pinch (which pulls velar F2 up toward palatals)
  #   - Keeping F2 coarticulation moderate (0.7 instead of 1.0)
  #   - Using MITalk-K locus weighting to anchor consonants
  #
  # This lets labials, alveolars, and nasals coarticulate naturally while
  # keeping velars safely separated from palatals.

  # === BOUNDARY SMOOTHING ===
  # Crisp ≠ discontinuous. Even fast Hungarian speech has ~5-8ms of formant
  # transition at segment boundaries. Without smoothing, every phoneme boundary
  # is a hard splice — a major source of roboticness.
  # Using shorter values than English to preserve Hungarian consonant clarity.

  # === STOP CLOSURE ===

  # mode gives closures where they matter without chopping every syllable.

  # === SEGMENT BOUNDARIES ===

  # Hungarian is syllable-timed — syllables should flow, not be chopped.
  # A small gap (4ms) is enough to prevent cross-segment artifacts.

  # === ALLOPHONE RULES ===
  # Hungarian intervocalic /h/ is realized as voiced [ɦ] in natural speech.
  # This eliminates the voiced→voiceless→voiced energy dip that causes
  # transition pops on words like "tehát", "ahogy", "ehez".
  # The [ɦ] phoneme has _copyAdjacent: true, so it inherits surrounding
  # vowel formant colors — just like /h/ does, but with voicing maintained.
