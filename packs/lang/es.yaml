  replacements:
    # eSpeak Spanish often emits "ʝ" for initial <y> (e.g. "yo").
    # Our base phoneme table doesn't include ʝ, so map it to the glide /j/ to keep the consonant audible.
    - from: "ʝ"
      to:   "j"
    # Some voices use the affricate ɟʝ; map it to /j/ as well.
    - from: "ɟʝ"
      to:   "j"
