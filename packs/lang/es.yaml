  replacements:
    # Palatal nasal: some tables emit ñ as nʲ (or n͡ʲ). Map it to /ɲ/ so it doesn't collapse to plain /n/.
    - from: "n͡ʲ"
      to:   "ɲ"
    - from: "nʲ"
      to:   "ɲ"
    - from: "ɲʲ"
      to:   "ɲ"

    # eSpeak Spanish often emits "ʝ" for initial <y>/<ll> (e.g. "yo").
    # We have a dedicated ʝ phoneme; keep it.
    # If a voice uses the affricate ɟʝ, collapse it to ʝ to avoid an overly "hard" onset.
    - from: "ɟʝ"
      to:   "ʝ"
