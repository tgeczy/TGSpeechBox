  # ------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Special coarticulation for RP / British English.
  #
  # Key differences from en-us:
  #   - Non-rhotic: no rhotic vowel coloring (post-vocalic R is deleted
  #     by normalization; onset /ɹ/ before vowels doesn't strongly color
  #     the vowel in RP the way American R does).
  #   - Labial rounding is slightly less prominent.
  #   - Palatal fronting from /j/ (yod) — RP preserves yod in "tune",
  #     "new", "duke" where US drops it.  The /j/ raises F2 on the
  #     following vowel, brightening the onset.
