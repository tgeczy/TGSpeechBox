normalization:
  preReplacements:
    # Map IPA palatalization marker ʲ to internal key (U+E001) to avoid engine bug.
    - from: "ʲ"
      to: ""
    # eSpeak bg often uses plain sequences for affricates.
    - from: "ts"

    # Bulgarian does not have phonemic vowel length. eSpeak occasionally emits
    # length marks (e.g. word-final iː). Strip them to avoid unnatural stretching.
    - from: "ː"
      to: ""

  replacements:
    # eSpeak bg (--ipa) commonly emits schwa for the vowel written "ъ".
    # In NVSP we keep this distinct as ɤ.
    - from: "ə"
      to: "ɤ"

    # Bulgarian /e/ is typically [ɛ] (open-mid) rather than [e].
    # eSpeak uses the plain 'e' symbol, so remap it to our 'ɛ' phoneme.
    - from: "e"
      to: "ɛ"
    # Slavic palatalization marker: keep ʲ as its own token (phonemes.yaml defines a subtle ʲ offglide).
