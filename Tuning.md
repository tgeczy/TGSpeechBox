# NV Speech Player – Language Pack & Phoneme Tuning Guide

This document covers language pack configuration, phoneme tuning, voice profiles, normalization rules, and frontend processing passes.

> **Note on dictionaries:** Pronunciation dictionaries, user dictionaries, stress dictionaries, and compound splitting are covered in **[Dictionary-editing.md](Dictionary-editing.md)**. Dictionaries operate above the phoneme/pack level — they intercept text before it reaches eSpeak and redirect pronunciation at the word level. This guide focuses on the lower-level tuning: phoneme formant values, language pack settings, allophone rules, and DSP parameters.
>
> **Dictionary ↔ YAML interaction:** The `dictSuffixes` setting (see [Dictionary suffix stripping](#dictionary-suffix-stripping) below) is defined in language pack YAML but affects dictionary lookup behavior. When tuning a language, consider both the YAML settings here and the dictionary configuration in Dictionary-editing.md.

## phonemes.yaml
`packs/phonemes.yaml` defines how each phoneme maps to Klatt-style frame parameters. Keys are IPA symbols or internal symbols (we use some private keys like `ᴇ`, `ᴒ`, etc. for language-specific tuning).

Example (shortened):
```yaml
phonemes:
  "0":
    _isVowel: true
    _isVoiced: true
    voiceAmplitude: 0.9
    cf1: 500
    cf2: 1400
    cf3: 2300
    cb1: 110
    cb2: 45
    cb3: 82.5
```

## Voice profiles (optional)
Voice profiles let you change the *character* of the voice (female, child, deep, etc.) without keeping separate phoneme tables. The base `phonemes:` map stays the same; a profile is just an overlay that scales or overrides some parameters.

**Where they live:** voice profiles are defined in `packs/phonemes.yaml`, not in the per-language YAML files.

**Basic shape:**
```yaml
phonemes:
  "a":
    _isVowel: true
    cf1: 700
    cf2: 1200

voiceProfiles:
  female:
    classScales:
      vowel:
        cf_mul: [1.12, 1.16, 1.18, 1.08, 1.04, 1.02]
        pf_mul: [1.12, 1.16, 1.18, 1.08, 1.04, 1.02]
        voicePitch_mul: 1.4        # raise pitch ~40%
        endVoicePitch_mul: 1.4
        glottalOpenQuotient_mul: 1.08  # slightly breathier
      consonant:
        voicePitch_mul: 1.4
        endVoicePitch_mul: 1.4
      unvoicedFricative:
        fricationAmplitude_mul: 0.95
        aspirationAmplitude_mul: 0.95
    phonemeOverrides:
      "i":
        cf2: 2500  # absolute value
        pf2: 2500
```

**Inflection per profile:** a profile may carry `inflectionScale` (number, default `1.0`) at its top level, next to `classScales`. It multiplies the listener's inflection setting while the profile is active, so a profile can be livelier or flatter than the slider alone. The product is capped at 1.5 (the platform sliders top out at 1.0). Example: `inflectionScale: 1.3`. The phoneme editor's "Save to Profile" suggests it from the editor's inflection slider relative to 50, the default the NVDA driver, Android and iOS start from.

**How a profile's `voicingTone` meets the listener's sliders (3.10 beta 10):** the frontend reads 17 keys from a profile's `voicingTone` (the ones listed below; `creakiness`, `breathiness`, `jitter`, `shimmer`, `sharpness` and the chorus keys are listener settings and are ignored there). A block that leaves out `highShelfGainDb` plays 5.5 dB, where a voice without a block plays 4 dB. In the NVDA add-on the voice tilt slider adds to the profile's tilt, and the pre-emphasis, high-shelf and nasal keys come from the profile; the NVDA sliders for speed quotient, head size (`f4FreqScale`), noise modulation, pitch-sync F1/B1, aspiration tilt, formant sharpness (`cascadeBwScale`), tremor and chorus set those values outright, so the profile's own values for them do not reach NVDA listeners. SAPI keeps the profile's speed quotient, noise modulation, pitch-sync, aspiration tilt, formant sharpness and tremor unless the listener has set that slider, but does not take head size or the two nasal scales from a profile at all. Making every host honour a profile's values at neutral listener settings is required before 3.10 final. The phoneme editor's Save to Profile writes only the keys whose sliders moved away from what the source voice plays, and writes `highShelfGainDb` explicitly whenever adding or emptying a block would otherwise change the shelf the profile played, so an untouched save changes nothing.

### Voice profile integration

The NVDA driver uses these parameters in voice profiles defined in `phonemes.yaml`. Under the `voicingTone` key, profiles can specify any of these parameters to create distinct voice characters:

```yaml
voiceProfiles:
  Beth:
    voicingTone:
      voicedTiltDbPerOct: -6.0
      highShelfGainDb: 2.0
      highShelfFcHz: 2800.0
      noiseGlottalModDepth: 0.3
```

### Class names you can use
These match the flags already present in phoneme entries (like `_isVowel`, `_isVoiced`, etc.):
- `vowel`
- `consonant` (fallback for any non-vowel)
- `voicedConsonant`
- `voicedFricative`
- `unvoicedFricative`
- `nasal`
- `liquid`
- `stop`
- `affricate`
- `semivowel`

### Supported scale fields
Class scales are *multipliers*:

**Formant multipliers (arrays or scalar shorthand):**
- `cf_mul`, `pf_mul` (formant frequency multipliers for F1..F6)
- `cb_mul`, `pb_mul` (bandwidth multipliers for B1..B6)
- `pa_mul` (parallel formant amplitude multipliers for A1..A6)

**Pitch multipliers:**
- `voicePitch_mul` (fundamental frequency)
- `endVoicePitch_mul` (end pitch for contours)

**Vibrato multipliers:**
- `vibratoPitchOffset_mul` (vibrato depth)
- `vibratoSpeed_mul` (vibrato rate)

**Voice quality multipliers:**
- `voiceTurbulenceAmplitude_mul` (breathiness)
- `glottalOpenQuotient_mul` (glottal open quotient)

**Amplitude multipliers:**
- `voiceAmplitude_mul`
- `aspirationAmplitude_mul`
- `fricationAmplitude_mul`
- `preFormantGain_mul`
- `outputGain_mul`

**Scalar shorthand:** for `cf_mul` / `pf_mul` / `cb_mul` / `pb_mul` / `pa_mul`, you can provide a single number and it will be replicated across all 6 formants. Example: `cf_mul: 1.12` means `cf_mul: [1.12, 1.12, 1.12, 1.12, 1.12, 1.12]`.

### Per-phoneme overrides (`phonemeOverrides`)

Use `phonemeOverrides` when your profile is *mostly* right, but **one specific phoneme** still sounds off.

**What it does**
- Values in `phonemeOverrides` are **absolute assignments** for that phoneme (not multipliers).
- Overrides are applied **after** `classScales`.
- If an override sets a field, it **wins for that field only**. Other fields still come from the base phoneme + any class scaling.

**Effective order (per field)**
1. Start with the phoneme's base value from `phonemes:`
2. Apply any matching `classScales` multipliers
3. Apply `phonemeOverrides` (only for the fields you specify)

**Tip**  
Override the **smallest number of fields** you can (often just `cf2`, or `cf1 + cf2` on one vowel).  
If you're overriding lots of phonemes, it usually means your `classScales` need tuning.

**Example**
```yaml
voiceProfiles:
  female:
    classScales:
      vowel:
        cf_mul: [1.12, 1.16, 1.18, 1.08, 1.04, 1.02]
    phonemeOverrides:
      "i":
        cf2: 2550
      "s":
        fricationAmplitude: 40
```

### How to enable a profile
Preferred: select a profile at runtime via the frontend API:
```c
// Enable
nvspFrontend_setVoiceProfile(handle, "female");

// Disable (back to base phonemes)
nvspFrontend_setVoiceProfile(handle, "");

// Read current profile ("" if none)
const char* profile = nvspFrontend_getVoiceProfile(handle);
```

### Debugging: pack load warnings
If a profile isn't taking effect (typo, YAML error, etc.), read the pack warnings:
```c
const char* warnings = nvspFrontend_getPackWarnings(handle);
if (warnings && warnings[0] != '\0') {
    // show or log warnings
}
```

## Language YAML example (en.yaml)
Example (shortened):
```yaml
settings:
  stopClosureMode: always
  postStopAspirationEnabled: true

normalization:
  classes:
    BATH_FOLLOW: ["s", "f", "θ"]
  replacements:
    - from: "a"
      to: "æ"
    - from: "æ"
      to: "ɑː"
      when:
        beforeClass: BATH_FOLLOW
```

## Language pack settings reference
Below is a reference for language pack `settings` values used by the frontend.

### Stress and timing
- `primaryStressDiv` (number, default `1.4`): Slows down the entire syllable carrying primary stress. Higher = more slowdown. **Bypassed when `prominence.enabled` is true** — the prominence pass handles stress realization on vowels instead.
- `secondaryStressDiv` (number, default `1.1`): Slows down secondary stress syllables. **Bypassed when `prominence.enabled` is true.**

### Stop closure insertion
These settings control the short "silence gap" inserted before stops/affricates (helps clarity, especially for consonant clusters).
- `stopClosureMode` (string, default `"vowel-and-cluster"`): One of:
  - `"always"`: insert a closure gap before every stop/affricate (clearest, can sound clicky)
  - `"after-vowel"`: only after vowels
  - `"vowel-and-cluster"`: after vowels, and also in some clusters (balanced)
  - `"none"`: never insert closure gaps
- `stopClosureClusterGapsEnabled` (bool, default `true`): Enables the cluster part of `"vowel-and-cluster"`.
- `stopClosureAfterNasalsEnabled` (bool, default `false`): If true, allows closure gaps before stops even after nasals. Helpful when nasal+stop clusters swallow the stop at higher rates.
- `stopClosureNasalToStopGapMs` (number, default `0.0`): When > 0, inserts a dedicated short closure gap between nasals and following stops (/mp/, /nt/, /nk/). This prevents the stop burst from being swallowed at speed — the shared place of articulation means boundary smoothing can erase the acoustic discontinuity without an explicit gap. Uses its own timing (typically 10ms gap / 2ms fade) to avoid the "click" artifacts that caused `stopClosureAfterNasalsEnabled` to default to false. Enabled at 10ms across 20 language packs (Spanish, Portuguese, French, Finnish, German, Italian, Polish, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Turkish, Czech, Slovak, Croatian, Romanian, Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian). English excluded (often unreleased nasal+stop). Hungarian uses the older `stopClosureAfterNasalsEnabled` instead.
- `stopClosureNasalToStopFadeMs` (number, default `0.0`): Fade duration for the nasal-to-stop closure gap. Typically 2ms (vs the general cluster fade of 4ms).

### Stop closure gap timing (ms at speed=1.0)
- `stopClosureVowelGapMs` (number, default `41.0`)
- `stopClosureVowelFadeMs` (number, default `10.0`)
  - Duration/fade of closure gaps inserted after vowels.
- `stopClosureClusterGapMs` (number, default `22.0`)
- `stopClosureClusterFadeMs` (number, default `4.0`)
  - Duration/fade of closure gaps inserted in clusters.
- `stopClosureWordBoundaryClusterGapMs` (number, default `0.0`)
- `stopClosureWordBoundaryClusterFadeMs` (number, default `0.0`)
  - If set (>0), overrides the cluster gap timing only when the stop/affricate is at a word boundary (word start).

### Coda noise taper (fricative→stop continuity)
When a fricative precedes a coda stop (e.g. /st/ in "list", /sk/ in "risk"), the closure gap normally emits true silence, which drains the DSP's resonators and triggers aggressive burst detection on the following stop. The coda noise taper replaces that silence with a two-phase source path crossfade:

- **Early taper**: frication fading (parallel-dominant, sibilant tail)
- **Late taper**: aspiration rising (cascade-dominant, formants blending toward the stop's place)

This rotates the noise character from sibilant to aspirated across the closure so the burst fires into warm cascade resonators. The DSP's adaptive burst detection sees small dFric and stays on the sustain LP path, preserving spectral continuity. Only activates for coda clusters (`!wordStart` guard) — onset clusters like /st/ in "style" are unaffected.

- `codaNoiseTaperEnabled` (bool, default `true`): Master enable for the taper.
- `codaNoiseTaperPreGain` (number, default `0.40`): preFormantGain during taper (keeps both signal paths alive).
- `codaNoiseTaperEarlyFricScale` (number, default `0.45`): Early taper frication as fraction of preceding fricative level.
- `codaNoiseTaperEarlyAspAmp` (number, default `0.04`): Early taper aspiration amplitude (cascade barely waking).
- `codaNoiseTaperLateFricScale` (number, default `0.08`): Late taper frication as fraction of preceding level (parallel almost gone).
- `codaNoiseTaperLateAspAmp` (number, default `0.22`): Late taper aspiration amplitude (cascade now dominant).

The late taper also blends F2/F3 40% toward the stop's formant targets, smoothing the spectral handoff for cross-place clusters like /sk/ and /sp/.

### Segment boundary timing (between chunks)
These settings help when callers stitch speech from multiple chunks (common in NVDA UI speech: label / role / value).
- `segmentBoundaryGapMs` (number, default `0.0`)
- `segmentBoundaryFadeMs` (number, default `0.0`)
  - If non-zero, inserts a short silence frame between consecutive frontend queue calls on the same handle.
- `segmentBoundarySkipVowelToVowel` (bool, default `true`)
  - If true, skips the segment-boundary silence when a chunk ends with a vowel/semivowel and the next chunk begins with a vowel/semivowel (to avoid audible gaps across diphthongs).
- `segmentBoundarySkipVowelToLiquid` (bool, default `false`)
  - If true, also skips the segment-boundary silence when a chunk ends with a vowel/semivowel and the next chunk begins with a liquid-like consonant (liquids/taps/trills). This can help reduce audible seams in vowel+R transitions across chunks if it's noticeable in your language.

### Automatic diphthong handling
These settings optionally add tie bars for vowel+vowel sequences that should behave like a diphthong.
- `autoTieDiphthongs` (bool, default `false`): If true, the frontend can mark eligible vowel+vowel pairs as tied (diphthongs) even when the IPA lacks a tie bar.
- `autoDiphthongOffglideToSemivowel` (bool, default `false`): If true (and `autoTieDiphthongs` is enabled), convert the diphthong offglide to a semivowel (`i/ɪ → j`, `u/ʊ → w`) when those phonemes exist.

### Semivowel offglide shortening
If your pack represents diphthongs using a vowel+semivowel sequence (for example `eɪ → ej`), you may hear a tiny "syllable break" when that semivowel is followed by a vowel or a liquid-like consonant inside the same word (e.g. "player", "later").

- `semivowelOffglideScale` (number, default `1.0`)
  - If set to anything other than `1.0`, the engine multiplies the duration and fade of semivowel tokens in the pattern `vowel + semivowel + (vowel | liquid | tap | trill)`.
  - Values below `1.0` make those semivowels shorter and more "glide-like" without affecting word-final diphthongs like "day".

### Liquid dynamics (optional)

These settings add internal movement to liquids and glides, so they don't sound "stuck" on one static shape (especially noticeable on **/l/**, **/r/**, and **/w/**).

You can write them as a nested block (preferred):

```yaml
settings:
  liquidDynamics:
    enabled: true

    # /l/ clarity
    lateralOnglide:
      f1Delta: -50
      f2Delta: 200
      durationPct: 0.30

    # American-style rhotic quality
    rhoticF3Dip:
      enabled: true
      f3Minimum: 1600
      dipDurationPct: 0.50

    # /w/ should start labial and move toward the vowel
    labialGlideTransition:
      enabled: true
      startF1: 300
      startF2: 700
      transitionPct: 0.60
```

Flat-key equivalents are also supported:

- `liquidDynamicsEnabled`
- `liquidDynamicsLateralOnglideF1Delta`
- `liquidDynamicsLateralOnglideF2Delta`
- `liquidDynamicsLateralOnglideDurationPct`
- `liquidDynamicsRhoticF3DipEnabled`
- `liquidDynamicsRhoticF3Minimum`
- `liquidDynamicsRhoticF3DipDurationPct`
- `liquidDynamicsLabialGlideTransitionEnabled`
- `liquidDynamicsLabialGlideStartF1`
- `liquidDynamicsLabialGlideStartF2`
- `liquidDynamicsLabialGlideTransitionPct`

Implementation note: the frontend splits the token into a short "onglide" segment + a steady segment and uses a small internal crossfade.

### Intra-word stressed vowel hiatus break (spelling aid)
These settings can insert a tiny silence between two adjacent vowels when the *second* vowel is explicitly stressed. This mostly exists to help spelled-out acronyms (initialisms) where two letter names meet with no consonant in between.
- `stressedVowelHiatusGapMs` (number, default `0.0`): Gap duration in milliseconds at speed=1.0. The engine divides it by current speed.
- `stressedVowelHiatusFadeMs` (number, default `0.0`): Fade duration (crossfade) for that gap frame.

### Uniform word-boundary amplitude dip
Emits a brief reduced-amplitude micro-frame at every `wordStart` token in `frame_emit.cpp`. This provides a consistent boundary cue regardless of phonetic context — V#V, C#V, V#C all get the same subtle energy dip. Consonant boundaries already have natural acoustic discontinuities, so the dip simply reinforces them; V#V (e.g. "the installer") benefits most because it's the only context lacking a natural break.
- `wordBoundaryDipMs` (number, default `0.0`): Duration of the dip micro-frame in ms. Only fires when > 0 and the token has enough remaining duration. en-us uses `3.0`.
- `wordBoundaryDipDepth` (number, default `0.70`): Amplitude multiplier during the dip (0.70 = 30% reduction). Applies to `voiceAmplitude`, `fricationAmplitude`, and `aspirationAmplitude`. en-us uses `0.50`.

Nested key path: flat keys only (no nested block).

### Spelling diphthong handling
This is a more speech-like alternative to inserting a pause. It changes how some letter-name diphthongs are rendered when the word looks like a spelled-out acronym.
- `spellingDiphthongMode` (string, default "none"): One of:
  - `none`: do nothing
  - `monophthong`: in acronym-like words, treat the English letter name **A** (/eɪ/, often pack-normalized to /ej/) as a long monophthong by dropping the offglide and marking the nucleus lengthened. This reduces the unwanted "y"-glide in cases like "NVDA".

### Dictionary suffix stripping
When a word isn't found in the pronunciation dictionary, the frontend tries stripping per-language suffixes (longest-first) and looking up the remaining stem. If the stem matches, the text respelling is used with the suffix reattached, so eSpeak phonemizes the suffix naturally in context.

- `dictSuffixes` (string list, default `[]`): Per-language list of suffixes to try. Pre-sorted longest-first at load time. Only stems of 3+ characters are considered (prevents false matches on short words like "as" → "a" + "s").

Example (English, in `en.yaml`):
```yaml
settings:
  dictSuffixes:
    - "'s"
    - "ing"
    - "est"
    - "ed"
    - "er"
    - "es"
    - "ly"
    - "s"
```

With a dict entry `launch → lawnch`, speaking "launching" automatically produces "lawnching". For IPA-injection entries (those with `toIpa` set), the text respelling path is used instead of IPA splitting, so suffixes like "'s" get natural connected-speech phonemization (e.g. /z/ after voiced sounds, not the letter "ess").

Agglutinative languages like Hungarian and Turkish have large suffix lists (42 and 22 entries respectively) covering case endings, plurals, and diminutives. Isolating languages like Chinese have no suffixes. See each language's YAML for the full list.

### Post-stop aspiration insertion (English-style)
- `postStopAspirationEnabled` (bool, default `false`): Inserts a short aspiration phoneme after unvoiced stops in specific contexts.
- `postStopAspirationPhoneme` (string/IPA key, default `"h"`): Which phoneme key to insert for aspiration.

### Allophone rules (YAML-driven rule engine)

This pass replaces the older hardcoded `positionalAllophones` system with a generic, data-driven rule engine. Language pack authors can define allophone rules entirely in YAML without C++ changes.

Rules support five action types: **replace** (swap phoneme), **scale** (multiply duration/fields), **shift** (Hz deltas or blend-toward-target), **insert-before**, and **insert-after**. Replace and insert rules are first-match-wins (exclusive); scale and shift rules are cumulative (all matching rules apply).

```yaml
settings:
  allophoneRules:
    enabled: true
    rules:
      # Intervocalic flapping: /t,d/ → [ɾ] before unstressed vowel
      - name: american_flapping
        phonemes: [t, d]
        position: intervocalic
        stress: next-unstressed
        action: replace
        replaceTo: "ɾ"
        replaceDurationMs: 14.0
        replaceRemovesClosure: true
        replaceRemovesAspiration: true

      # /l/ darkness: post-vocalic /l/ blends F2 toward 900 Hz
      - name: dark_l_post_vocalic

        action: scale
        durationScale: 0.85
        fieldScales:
          fricationAmplitude: 0.4
          aspirationAmplitude: 0.3

      # Glottal reinforcement: insert [ʔ] before word-final voiceless stops
      - name: glottal_reinforcement
        flags: [stop]
        notFlags: [voiced]
        position: word-final
        action: insert-before
        insertPhoneme: "ʔ"
        insertDurationMs: 18.0
```

#### Detailed action parameters

**replace** additional fields:
- `replaceClosureScale` (number, default `0.0`): If > 0, scale the adjacent closure token's duration instead of removing it. Useful when you want to keep a shortened closure (e.g. `0.5` halves the closure).
- `replaceAspirationScale` (number, default `0.0`): If > 0, scale the adjacent aspiration token's duration and inject breathiness into the main token instead of removing aspiration entirely.

**scale** additional fields:
- `fadeScale` (number, default `1.0`): Multiplier for the token's crossfade time. Values < 1.0 make transitions crisper; > 1.0 makes them smoother.

**insert-before / insert-after** additional fields:
- `insertFadeMs` (number, default `3.0`): Crossfade duration for the inserted token (ms at speed=1.0).
- `insertContexts` (list of strings): If non-empty, the insertion only happens when at least one context matches. Valid contexts:
  - `"V_#"` — previous phoneme is a vowel AND current token is word-final
  - `"#_#"` — current token is word-final

#### Position and stress details

- **`syllabic`**: Matches when the phoneme has no adjacent vowel on either side (i.e. it IS the syllable nucleus). Useful for syllabic consonants like dark /l/ in "bottle".
- **`prev-stressed`**: Matches when the preceding phoneme carries stress (stress > 0).

#### Class-based neighbor matching

The `afterFlags`/`beforeFlags`/`notAfterFlags`/`notBeforeFlags` fields let you match based on the *class* of adjacent phonemes rather than specific IPA keys. This is more maintainable than listing every possible phoneme.

```yaml
# Example: only darken /l/ when preceded by a back vowel
- name: dark_l_after_back_vowel
  phonemes: [l]
  afterFlags: [vowel]        # prev must be a vowel
  position: post-vocalic
  action: shift
  fieldShifts:
    - field: cf2
      targetHz: 900
      blend: 0.8
```

The flag names used in these fields are the same as `flags`/`notFlags`: `stop`, `vowel`, `voiced`, `nasal`, `liquid`, `semivowel`, `affricate`, `tap`, `trill`.

#### Place of articulation matching

The `place` field filters by articulatory position, derived from the phoneme's IPA key via `getPlace()`. This is useful for place-specific tuning without listing every phoneme at that place.

```yaml
# Example: boost labial stops at word-final position (lip seal radiates
# less high-frequency energy, so they need extra burst/aspiration)
- name: labial_word_final_boost
  flags: [stop]
  notFlags: [voiced]
  place: labial
  position: word-final
  action: scale
  fieldScales:
    aspirationAmplitude: 1.50
    pa1: 1.40
    pa2: 1.30
```

Place mappings: **labial** (/p,b,m,f,v,w,ʍ,ɸ,β/), **alveolar** (/t,d,n,s,z,l,r,ɹ,ɾ,θ,ð,ɬ,ɮ,ɻ,ɖ,ʈ,ɳ,ɽ/), **palatal** (/ʃ,ʒ,t͡ʃ,d͡ʒ,j,ɲ,ç,ʝ,c,ɟ,ʎ/ — tie-bar affricates recognized), **velar** (/k,g,ŋ,x,ɣ,ɰ/). Phonemes not in any group return `Unknown` and won't match any place filter.

#### Cross-word boundary conditions

The `nextWordStartsClass`/`nextWordStartsNotClass` and `prevWordEndsClass`/`prevWordEndsNotClass` fields let rules look across word boundaries. These are only meaningful when combined with `atWordEnd: true` or `atWordStart: true` respectively. Classes reference named character sets defined in the pack's `classes:` block.

```yaml
# Spanish: word-final /ɾ/ trills before consonants or silence,
# but stays a tap before vowels across word boundaries.
# "buscar esto" → tap links smoothly; "buscar pan" → trill.
- from: "ɾ"
  to: "ɾ_wfᵊɾ_wf"
  when:
    atWordEnd: true
    nextWordStartsNotClass: VOWELS
```

This is useful for any language with word-boundary-sensitive allophones: Spanish rhotics, English linking-r, French liaison, etc.

#### Important notes

- **Neighbor matching** uses `prevPhoneme`/`nextPhoneme` which skip closure, aspiration, and gap tokens — so intervocalic checks work correctly even when stops have inserted closure/aspiration tokens between them.
- **`isWordFinalPhoneme`** looks past trailing aspiration/closure tokens, so a stop followed by its aspiration token is still considered word-final.
- **eSpeak stress marks** land on syllable-initial consonants, not vowels. The `next-unstressed` check verifies both that the current token has `stress <= 0` AND that the next vowel is unstressed, preventing false matches on stressed consonants.
- **`intervocalic` excludes word-initial**: A stop at the start of a word is never treated as intervocalic, even if the previous word ended with a vowel. This prevents flapping from incorrectly applying to word-initial stops like the /d/ in "do".
- **Backward compatibility**: the old `positionalAllophones: enabled: true` syntax is still parsed and sets `allophoneRulesEnabled = true` (no rules are loaded from the old format).

### Length mark handling (ː)
- `lengthenedScale` (number, default `1.05`): Duration multiplier when a phoneme is lengthened with ː.
- `lengthenedScaleHu` (number, default `1.3`): Hungarian-specific length scaling (used by legacy behavior).
- `applyLengthenedScaleToVowelsOnly` (bool, default `true`): If true, ː only lengthens vowels.
- `lengthenedVowelFinalCodaScale` (number, default `1.0`): Additional multiplier for lengthened vowels (ː) when they occur in a word-final closed syllable (vowel + final consonant cluster), e.g. "rules" /ruːlz/. This is intentionally conservative: it does not apply when there are later vowels in the same word (e.g. "ruler" /ruːlə/).

### Length contrast and gemination (optional)

If a language has phonemic length (short vs long vowels) or geminate consonants, this pass helps keep those cues stable even at higher speech rates.

Nested block form (preferred):

```yaml
settings:
  lengthContrast:
    enabled: true

    # Vowel constraints (ms at speed=1)
    shortVowelCeiling: 80
    longVowelFloor: 120

    # Gemination cues
    geminateClosureScale: 1.8
    geminateReleaseScale: 0.9
    preGeminateVowelScale: 0.85
```

Flat-key equivalents are also supported:

- `lengthContrastEnabled`
- `lengthContrastShortVowelCeilingMs`
- `lengthContrastLongVowelFloorMs`
- `lengthContrastGeminateClosureScale`
- `lengthContrastGeminateReleaseScale`
- `lengthContrastPreGeminateVowelScale`

How it behaves:

- Short vowels are capped, long vowels are floored.
- For doubled consonants, the engine mainly lengthens the **closure gap** (the inserted pre-stop gap between the consonants), which is where gemination tends to "live" perceptually.
- The numbers are treated as **ms at speed=1**, and the effective limits are divided by the current speed so things don't explode at 3× speed.

### Language-specific duration tweaks
These are "compat switches" for behavior that existed in the legacy Python pipeline.
- `huShortAVowelEnabled` (bool, default `true`)
- `huShortAVowelKey` (string/IPA key, default `"ᴒ"`)
- `huShortAVowelScale` (number, default `0.85`): Scales Hungarian short "a" timing (using the phoneme key you map for it).
- `englishLongUShortenEnabled` (bool, default `true`)
- `englishLongUKey` (string/IPA key, default `"u"`)
- `englishLongUWordFinalScale` (number, default `0.80`): Shortens English long /uː/ in word-final position.

### Default frame values (applied unless phoneme sets them)
- `defaultPreFormantGain` (number, default `1.0`)
- `defaultOutputGain` (number, default `1.5`)
- `defaultVibratoPitchOffset` (number, default `0.0`)
- `defaultVibratoSpeed` (number, default `0.0`)
- `defaultVoiceTurbulenceAmplitude` (number, default `0.0`)
- `defaultGlottalOpenQuotient` (number, default `0.0`)

### Phoneme timing defaults (reference)
These values control the base duration of each phoneme type (ms at speed=1.0). They are currently hardcoded in the engine and not configurable via YAML, but are listed here for reference:

| Phoneme type | Default (ms) | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Vowel | 60 | `defaultVowelDurationMs` |
| Voiceless fricative | 45 | `voicelessFricativeDurationMs` — /s/, /f/, /ʃ/, /x/ |
| Trill | 40 | `trillFallbackDurationMs` (if `trillModulationMs` unset) |
| Vowel before nasal | 40 | `vowelBeforeNasalDurationMs` — unstressed V before N |
| Tied vowel (diphthong start) | 40 | `tiedVowelDurationMs` |
| Voiced consonant | 30 | `voicedConsonantDurationMs` — default for all voiced non-vowels |
| Vowel before liquid | 30 | `vowelBeforeLiquidDurationMs` — unstressed V before L/R |
| Affricate | 24 | `affricateDurationMs` — /t͡ʃ/, /d͡ʒ/ |
| Post-stop aspiration | 20 | `postStopAspirationDurationMs` |
| Tied-from vowel | 20 | `tiedFromVowelDurationMs` (diphthong end) |
| Tap | 14 | `tapDurationMs` — /ɾ/ |
| Default crossfade | 10 | `defaultFadeMs` |
| Stop burst | 6 | `stopDurationMs` — /p/, /t/, /k/, /b/, /d/, /g/ |

### Normalization cleanup
- `stripAllophoneDigits` (bool, default `true`): Removes eSpeak allophone digits from IPA streams (disable for tonal digit languages if needed).
- `stripHyphen` (bool, default `true`): Removes hyphens in IPA streams.

### Pitch model selection

The frontend supports five pitch models, selected via `legacyPitchMode`:

- `legacyPitchMode: "espeak_style"` (default) — Table-based intonation using ToBI-style regions (pre-head, head, nucleus, tail). The utterance is divided by stressed syllables, and each region gets a linear pitch path from `IntonationClause` parameters. The head section uses stepped pitch that cycles through `headSteps`, giving a characteristic eSpeak-like cadence.
- `legacyPitchMode: "legacy"` — Time-based pitch curves ported from the ee80f4d-era `ipa.py`. Gentle declination across the clause with stress accents on vowel nuclei. Produces a predictable "classic" screen reader prosody, especially at higher rates.
- `legacyPitchMode: "fujisaki_style"` — Fujisaki pitch model with exponential declination and accent peaks. This provides Eloquence-like intonation with smooth phrase-level pitch fall, stressed syllable peaks, and clause-final pitch shaping.
- `legacyPitchMode: "impulse_style"` — Additive impulse pitch model. Linear declination baseline with count-based stress peaks that diminish across the utterance (first stress gets the largest boost, subsequent stresses progressively smaller). Terminal gestures shape the final vowel by clause type. A two-pole IIR smoothing filter removes discontinuities, producing warm rounded pitch bumps.
- `legacyPitchMode: "arato_style"` — The BraiLab sentence melodies, after Arató András and Vaspöri Teréz (Arató, "A BraiLab beszélő számítógépcsalád", 1992, §5.4). One intonation unit per clause; the closing punctuation picks the shape: declaratives hump on the first syllable, decline in a straight line and plunge across the last two syllables; yes/no questions stay flat and rise on the penultimate syllable, falling on the last (long questions delay the rise); wh-questions and exclamations start at the peak and fall; comma clauses decline without a plunge and the next unit resets. Wh-questions are recognised by Arató's word-initial pairs (`aratoWhPairs`). Every shape constant is an `arato*St` setting in semitones, defaulting to values measured from the 1991 TALKHUN program.
- `legacyPitchMode: "klatt_style"` — Klatt 1987 hat-pattern intonation model. A three-state machine (BEFORE_HAT / ON_HAT / AFTER_HAT): pitch starts at a declining baseline, rises sharply on the first primary-stressed syllable, sustains a raised plateau with diminishing per-stress peaks, then falls back below baseline on the final stressed syllable. Statements get glottal lowering on the final vowel; questions rise instead of falling. Single-pole IIR smoothing.

Additional pitch settings:

- `legacyPitchInflectionScale` (number, default `0.58`): Multiplier for the caller-provided `inflection` (0..1) before applying pitch math. Historical NVSpeechPlayer used lower inflection values; this scaling prevents overly "excited" speech with modern configs.

#### Fujisaki pitch model settings

When `legacyPitchMode: "fujisaki_style"` is enabled, these settings control the intonation:

**Amplitude settings:**
- `fujisakiPhraseAmp` (number, default `0.24`): Phrase command amplitude in log-F0 domain. Controls the overall phrase arc.
- `fujisakiPrimaryAccentAmp` (number, default `0.24`): Primary stress accent amplitude. Creates pitch peaks on stressed syllables.
- `fujisakiSecondaryAccentAmp` (number, default `0.12`): Secondary stress accent amplitude.
- `fujisakiAccentMode` (string, default `"all"`): Which syllables get accents: `"all"`, `"first_only"`, or `"off"`.

**Timing settings (DSP filter lengths):**
- `fujisakiPhraseLen` (number, default `0`): Phrase filter length in samples. 0 = DSP default (~4250 @ 22050 Hz = 193ms).
- `fujisakiAccentLen` (number, default `0`): Accent filter attack time in samples. 0 = DSP default (~1024 @ 22050 Hz = 46ms).
- `fujisakiAccentDur` (number, default `0`): Accent pulse duration in samples. 0 = DSP default (~7500 @ 22050 Hz = 340ms).

**Declination settings (exponential pitch fall across utterance):**
- `fujisakiDeclinationRate` (number, default `0.0003`): Exponential decay steepness. Controls how fast pitch falls across the utterance. Higher = steeper fall. The exponential formula `basePitch * exp(-rate * timeMs)` naturally asymptotes — fast initial fall that gradually flattens — so long sentences decline smoothly without ever hitting a hard floor.
  - `0.0002` = gentle slope, stays lively longer
  - `0.0003` = natural conversational declination (default)
  - `0.0005` = steep fall for dramatic effect

**Prominence-to-pitch shaping (used when `pitchFromProminence: true`):**
- `fujisakiPitchCurveExponent` (number, default `1.0`): Power curve applied to prominence before scaling accent amplitude. Values >1.0 compress secondary stress for better audible contrast between primary and secondary syllables. At 1.0 the mapping is linear (original behavior). Recommended: `1.4` — maps prominence 0.6 → 0.49 instead of 0.60, giving real separation between "LOCK" and "box" in compounds.
- `fujisakiMonoAccentDurScale` (number, default `1.0`): Scales `fujisakiAccentDur` for single-nucleus content words. Monosyllable words benefit from a shorter, punchier accent pulse — a quick pitch pop that rises and falls within the single vowel. Recommended: `0.7` (30% shorter accent pulse).
- `fujisakiCompoundDeclinStep` (number, default `0.0`): Log-F0 step-down applied when a secondary-stressed vowel follows a primary-stressed one in the same word. Reinforces primary-secondary contrast beyond just the accent amplitude difference. `0.0` = off, `0.04-0.08` = subtle, `0.10+` = strong. Recommended: `0.05`.

**Deprecated declination settings** (kept for YAML backward compatibility, no longer used):
- `fujisakiDeclinationScale`, `fujisakiDeclinationMax`, `fujisakiDeclinationPostFloor`, `fujisakiPhraseDecay` — these were used by earlier linear and multi-phrase implementations. Existing YAML files referencing them will parse without warnings but the values have no effect.

**Clause-type prosody overrides (6 settings × 3 clause types = 18 settings):**

The Fujisaki model adjusts prosody based on punctuation. Statements (`.`) use the base Fujisaki parameters unchanged. Questions (`?`), exclamations (`!`), and commas (`,`) each apply a set of 6 multipliers that reshape the pitch contour for that clause type. These were previously hardcoded in C++ — they are now per-language-pack YAML settings, which means dialect-specific intonation patterns (e.g. Caribbean Spanish questions vs Castilian questions) can be tuned without touching engine code.

| Setting | What it does | Question default | Exclamation default | Comma default |
|---------|-------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `phraseAmpScale` | Scales the phrase arc amplitude | 0.3 (weak arc) | 2.5 (strong arc) | 0.5 |
| `accentBoost` | Multiplier on accent amplitudes | 1.3 | 1.8 | 1.0 |
| `declinationScale` | Scales the declination rate | 0.15 (nearly flat) | 2.5 (steep fall) | 0.4 |
| `basePitchScale` | Scales the base pitch in Hz | 1.18 (raised) | 1.15 (raised) | 1.04 |
| `finalRiseScale` | Final vowel rise = primaryAccentAmp × this | 2.5 (strong rise) | 0.0 (off) | 0.0 |
| `finalDropScale` | Final vowel drop in log-F0 units | 0.0 (off) | 0.12 (snap down) | 0.0 |

These can be set two ways — flat keys for quick one-off overrides, or a nested block when overriding several values at once:

**Flat keys** (prefix = `fujisaki` + clause type + field name):
```yaml
settings:
  fujisakiQuestionBasePitchScale: 1.25
  fujisakiQuestionFinalRiseScale: 3.0
  fujisakiExclamationAccentBoost: 2.0
```

**Nested block** (under `fujisakiClauseType:`):
```yaml
settings:
  fujisakiClauseType:
    question:
      basePitchScale: 1.25
      finalRiseScale: 3.0
      declinationScale: 0.10
    exclamation:
      accentBoost: 2.0
      finalDropScale: 0.15
    comma:
      basePitchScale: 1.08
      finalRiseScale: 0.5
```

Statements (`.`) always use the base Fujisaki parameters directly — `fujisakiPhraseAmp`, `fujisakiDeclinationRate`, etc. The clause-type overrides scale on top of those base values. This means a language pack's base Fujisaki tuning determines the overall character, and the clause-type overrides shape how questions, exclamations, and commas deviate from that baseline.

This clause-final pitch shaping is essential for short utterances (single words, spelled letters) where exponential declination barely has time to create within-word pitch movement. It is also essential for dialect-specific prosody — Caribbean Spanish questions have a less dramatic rise than Castilian, Argentine Spanish uses wider pitch range with stronger accent boosts, and Mexican Spanish sits somewhere in between. Without these settings being YAML-exposed, every dialect would share the same hardcoded clause-type behavior regardless of its language pack.

Example configuration for Eloquence-like prosody:
```yaml
settings:
  legacyPitchMode: "fujisaki_style"
  fujisakiPhraseAmp: 0.24
  fujisakiPrimaryAccentAmp: 0.24
  fujisakiSecondaryAccentAmp: 0.12
  fujisakiDeclinationRate: 0.0003
  fujisakiPitchCurveExponent: 1.4
  fujisakiMonoAccentDurScale: 0.7
  fujisakiCompoundDeclinStep: 0.05
```

Example regional override — Argentine Spanish with wider pitch range and dramatic questions:
```yaml
settings:
  legacyPitchMode: "fujisaki_style"
  fujisakiPrimaryAccentAmp: 0.28
  fujisakiClauseType:
    question:
      accentBoost: 1.6
      basePitchScale: 1.22
      finalRiseScale: 3.0
    exclamation:
      accentBoost: 2.2
```

*Note: The Fujisaki pitch model implementation was developed with assistance from Rommix, whose extensive testing and feedback on timing parameters helped shape the final behavior.*

#### Impulse pitch model settings

When `legacyPitchMode: "impulse_style"` is enabled, these settings control the intonation:

**Declination:**
- `impulseDeclinationRangeHz` (number, default `0`): Proportional declination range in Hz. When > 0, pitch starts at +range/2 and ends at -range/2, distributed across the voiced duration. This replaces the fixed Hz/sec slope for more natural-sounding decline on any length utterance.
- `impulseDeclinationHzPerSec` (number, default `12.0`): Legacy fixed-rate pitch fall in Hz per second. Only used when `impulseDeclinationRangeHz` is 0.

**Hat pattern (rise/fall at word boundaries):**
- `impulseRiseHz` (number, default `10.0`): Pitch rise at the onset of a word containing a primary-stressed vowel.
- `impulseHatFallScale` (number, default `2.0`): Multiplier on the fall at word exit (fall = riseHz * hatFallScale). Since fall > rise, each cycle contributes a net decline that reinforces the baseline ramp.
- The hat offset decays by 15% at each word boundary (leaky integrator), preventing unbounded pitch accumulation over long phrases.
- Pitch is floored at `basePitch * 0.75` to prevent unnaturally low values.

**Stress peaks (count-based diminishing boosts):**
- `impulseFirstStressBoostHz` (number, default `20.0`): Pitch boost (Hz) on the first primary-stressed vowel.
- `impulseSecondStressBoostHz` (number, default `9.0`): Boost on the second stressed vowel.
- `impulseThirdStressBoostHz` (number, default `6.0`): Boost on the third stressed vowel.
- `impulseFourthStressBoostHz` (number, default `4.0`): Boost on all subsequent stressed vowels.
- `impulseQuestionReduction` (number, default `0.5`): Multiplier applied to stress peaks in questions (flattens peaks to leave room for the terminal rise).

**Terminal gestures (applied to the last vowel in the final word):**
- `impulseTerminalFallHz` (number, default `20.0`): Pitch drop for declarative/exclamatory endings.
- `impulseQuestionRiseHz` (number, default `25.0`): Pitch rise for questions.
- `impulseContinuationRiseHz` (number, default `12.0`): Pitch rise for commas/continuations.
- `impulseAssertiveness` (number, default `1.0`): Multiplier on the terminal fall. Values > 1 make statements sound more emphatic.

**Stress scaling:**
- `impulseStressGain` (number, default `1.0`): Global multiplier on all stress peaks.
- `impulseSecondaryStressScale` (number, default `0.5`): How much secondary stress peaks are reduced relative to primary.
- `impulseTerminalStressHz` (number, default `-8.0`): Pitch drop (Hz) on the terminal primary-stressed vowel in statements. Creates the characteristic falling intonation at clause end.

**Smoothing:**
- `impulseSmoothAlpha` (number, default `0.55`): Single-pass forward IIR filter coefficient (0..1). Lower = smoother contour with more rounded bumps; higher = more responsive to individual stress peaks.

Example configuration:
```yaml
settings:
  legacyPitchMode: "impulse_style"
  impulseDeclinationHzPerSec: 12.0
  impulseFirstStressBoostHz: 20.0
  impulseSmoothAlpha: 0.3
```

#### Klatt hat-pattern pitch model settings

When `legacyPitchMode: "klatt_style"` is enabled, these settings control the intonation:

**Hat rise and stress peaks:**
- `klattHatRiseHz` (number, default `30.0`): Pitch step-up (Hz) when entering the hat plateau on the first primary-stressed vowel. Scaled by inflection.
- `klattStress1Hz` (number, default `28.0`): Additive pitch peak on the 1st stressed vowel on the plateau.
- `klattStress2Hz` (number, default `16.0`): Peak on the 2nd stressed vowel.
- `klattStress3Hz` (number, default `13.0`): Peak on the 3rd stressed vowel.
- `klattStress4Hz` (number, default `11.0`): Peak on all subsequent stressed vowels.

**Declination and terminal gestures:**
- `klattDeclinationHzPerSec` (number, default `10.0`): Linear baseline declination rate.
- `klattFinalFallBelowBaseHz` (number, default `21.0`): How far below baseline the pitch drops on the hat fall for statements/exclamations.
- `klattQuestionRiseHz` (number, default `35.0`): Pitch rise on the last stressed vowel for questions (instead of a fall).
- `klattContinuationRiseHz` (number, default `15.0`): Pitch rise for commas/continuations.
- `klattGlottalLowerHz` (number, default `15.0`): Additional pitch drop on the very last vowel for statements/exclamations. Simulates glottal lowering at utterance end.

**Smoothing:**
- `klattSmoothAlpha` (number, default `0.4`): Single-pole IIR smoothing coefficient (0..1). Lower = smoother transitions between hat states; higher = more abrupt transitions.

Example configuration:
```yaml
settings:
  legacyPitchMode: "klatt_style"
  klattHatRiseHz: 30.0
  klattFinalFallBelowBaseHz: 21.0
  klattSmoothAlpha: 0.4
```

#### Arató (BraiLab) intonation settings

When `legacyPitchMode: "arato_style"` is enabled, the pass is a port of the intonation routine of the 1991 TALKHUN program (BraiLab PC, Arató András and Vaspöri Teréz), recovered by disassembly and traced byte-exactly in an emulator. It works in the program's own units: a start-pitch delta per clause type in the chip's pitch-byte units (2.441 Hz each), contour deltas in pitch-code units spread over spans of 12.8 ms frames by the program's own Bresenham ramp, and the Philips PCF8200's geometric pitch-increment table (codes 1..15 = 1.2 .. 45.2 Hz per frame) applied cumulatively. Every default is the program's constant; the inflection slider scales the result from `aratoInflectionRef` (0.5).

- Clause types (the program's table): `.` is type 1 when the clause starts with the article (`aratoArticles`), else type 2; `?` takes the wh-melody when the first two phoneme keys match `aratoWhPairs`, else yes/no (a two-syllable yes/no has its own branch); `!` takes the wh-melody; `,` and `;` are comma clauses. The program spoke a `:` clause flat at the base pitch; because screen readers end many labels with a colon, the default here treats `:` as a comma clause, and `aratoColonFlat: true` restores the flat original.
- Start pitch: `aratoStartArticle` (−7), `aratoStartDecl` (+4), `aratoStartWh` (+18), `aratoStartComma` (+4); yes/no and flat start at the base pitch. At the default 103 Hz these are 85 / 112 / 146 / 112 Hz.
- Declaratives: `aratoHumpCode` (12, +19.5 Hz on the first frame of the second word, article clauses only); `aratoDeclFallToLastSyll` (−20) then `aratoDeclFallEnd` (−28) for 2–5 syllables; `aratoDeclLongFallToLastWord` (−18) then `aratoDeclLongFallEnd` (−24) from six syllables; `aratoDeclOneSyllFall` (−40).
- Wh and exclamation: the fall starts at frame `aratoWhStartFrame` (11); `aratoWhOneSyllFall` (−15), `aratoWhTwoSyllFall` (−60), `aratoWhFall` (−44, to the second vowel +7) then `aratoWhTail` (−20).
- Microintonation (Arató §5.4, the PCF8200's "natural pulsation of formant frequencies and bandwidths"): `formantPulseMode` is `off` (default), `on`, or `arato` (only while `legacyPitchMode` is `arato_style`). Inside a vowel's steady portion the emitter alternates two states every `formantPulseMs` (12.8, the chip's frame): the second state lifts F1 by `formantPulseF1Depth` (0.06), lowers F2 by `formantPulseF2Depth` (0.07) and, on every `formantPulseBwEvery` (2) such piece, multiplies B1 and B3 by `formantPulseBwScale` (2.5); the pieces join with `formantPulseFadeMs` (2). Vowels that glide or carry formant end targets are left alone. The values were measured on the BraiLab's vowels (F1 587↔622, F2 932↔880, B3 50↔125, B1 125↔309 Hz); whether they help a 22 kHz cascade is an ear question, so the mode ships off.
- Yes/no: `aratoYnCreep` (+10 over the body), `aratoYnRise` (+19 in the four frames after the penultimate vowel), `aratoYnFall` (−47); one syllable `aratoYnOneSyllRise1`/`2` (+8, +20, no fall); two syllables `aratoYnTwoSyllRise` (+22) then `aratoYnTwoSyllFall` (−34).
- Comma: `aratoCommaFall` (−30 to the last word) then `aratoCommaRise` (+30 over the last word, always). The next clause restarts at its own start pitch.
- `aratoFramesPerSyllable` (26) is the program's frame density: its 12.8 ms frames at its own tempo. The pass sizes its virtual frame as the clause's duration divided by syllables × this value, so the frame count, and therefore the codes, stay the same at every rate and for our faster segments, as in the original where the tempo setting was never read by the intonation code. `aratoPitchByteHz` (2.441) is the chip's Hz per pitch-byte unit.

```yaml
settings:
  legacyPitchMode: "arato_style"
  aratoWhPairs: ["h o", "h á", "m i_hu", "m ɛ_hu", "k i_hu"]
  aratoArticles: ["ᴒ", "ᴒ z"]
```

### Tonal language support
- `tonal` (bool, default `false`): Enables tone parsing / tone contours.
- `toneDigitsEnabled` (bool, default `true`): Allows digits 1–5 as tone markers.
- `toneContoursMode` (string, default `"absolute"`): How tone contour points are interpreted:
  - `"absolute"`: points are absolute 0–100 pitch-percent values
  - `"relative"`: points are offsets from the syllable baseline
- `toneContoursAbsolute` (bool, default `true`): Low-level switch used by the code; `toneContoursMode` is the recommended YAML knob.

### Other pack sections (not in settings)

## Normalization

The `normalization` section controls how raw IPA from eSpeak is transformed before phoneme lookup. This is where you handle dialect differences, allophonic variation, and phoneme mappings.

```yaml
normalization:
  aliases:

### preReplacements vs replacements: Order Matters!

**This is critical for language pack authors to understand.**

The normalization pipeline runs in this order:
1. **`preReplacements`** — runs on raw IPA, before any other transforms
2. Internal processing (tie-bar handling, phoneme-specific transforms like ᵊ insertion)
3. **`replacements`** — runs after internal processing

**Why does this matter?** Some internal transforms insert characters (like the schwa-glide `ᵊ`) or modify tie bars (`͡`). If your rule depends on matching a specific pattern like `ɔːɹ`, it **must** run in `preReplacements` — otherwise internal transforms may have already changed the text to `ɔːᵊɹ` and your pattern won't match.

**Rule of thumb:**
- Use `preReplacements` for rules that must see the **original eSpeak IPA** before any modifications
- Use `replacements` for rules that should run **after** internal phoneme transforms

**Example:** FORCE vowel shortening in American English

The goal: shorten the vowel in "short", "sport", "report" (where ɹ is followed by a consonant) but keep it long in "door", "for", "score" (where ɹ is word-final).

```yaml
preReplacements:
  # Must be in preReplacements! By the time replacements runs,
  # internal transforms may have inserted ᵊ, changing ɔːɹ → ɔːᵊɹ
  - from: "ɔːɹ"
    to:   "ɔɹ"
    when:
      beforeClass: CONSONANTS
```

### Replacement conditions (`when`)

Each replacement can have an optional `when` block with these conditions:

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `atWordStart: true` | Match only at the beginning of a word |
| `atWordEnd: true` | Match only at the end of a word |
| `beforeClass: NAME` | Match only if the **next** character is in the named class |
| `afterClass: NAME` | Match only if the **previous** character is in the named class |
| `notBeforeClass: NAME` | Match only if the **next** character is **NOT** in the named class (or at end of string) |
| `notAfterClass: NAME` | Match only if the **previous** character is **NOT** in the named class (or at start of string) |

**Positive vs Negative conditions:**
- `beforeClass` / `afterClass` — rule applies **only if** the adjacent character is in the class
- `notBeforeClass` / `notAfterClass` — rule applies **only if** the adjacent character is **not** in the class (or there is no adjacent character)

**Example: Lengthening open syllables only**

```yaml
classes:
  CONSONANTS: ["b", "d", "f", "g", "k", "l", "m", "n", "p", "s", "t", "ɹ"]

replacements:
  # Add length mark to FORCE vowel, but NOT when followed by a consonant
  - from: "ɔːɹ"
    to:   "ɔːːɹ"
    when:
      notBeforeClass: CONSONANTS  # matches "door" (word-final) but not "short" (followed by t)
```

**Note:** Stress markers (`ˈ`, `ˌ`) are treated as transparent for all class checks. This lets rules match segment clusters like `rˈa` the same way they match `ra`.

### skipReplacements

Child language packs inherit all `replacements` and `preReplacements` from their parent. Sometimes a child pack needs to suppress a specific inherited rule rather than override it. `skipReplacements` is a list of `{from, to}` pairs that are removed from the merged rule set after inheritance is resolved.

```yaml
normalization:
  skipReplacements:
    - from: s
      to: s_es        # remove this specific rule from the parent
    - from: x
      to: x_es        # remove this one too
    - from: ɣ         # no 'to' — removes ALL rules with this 'from'
```

**When to use it:**

A parent pack (e.g. `es.yaml`) defines shared rules that remap base phonemes to language-tagged variants (`s → s_es`, `x → x_es`). A child dialect (e.g. `es-mx.yaml`) may have its own allophone for `/s/` — `s_mx` — and needs the parent's `s → s_es` rule gone before it adds its own `s → s_mx` rule.

Without `skipReplacements`, you'd have to duplicate the entire parent rule set and edit it, which defeats inheritance.

**Matching:**

- If `to` is specified: removes rules where both `from` and the first `to` candidate match.
- If `to` is omitted: removes all inherited rules with that `from`, regardless of target.

**Order of operations:**

`skipReplacements` is applied after the full inheritance chain is merged, so it sees the complete inherited rule list before any of the child's own rules are applied. The child's own `replacements` are added afterward and are never affected.

**Real example — es-mx.yaml:**

```yaml
normalization:
  skipReplacements:
    - from: x
      to: x_es        # Mexican /x/ is softer — base x already sounds right
    - from: s
      to: s_es        # Mexican /s/ is laminal, not apical — s_mx handles it

  replacements:
    - from: s
      to: s_mx        # laminal Mexican sibilant
```

### transforms
Rules that match phonemes by properties (`isVowel`, `isStop`, etc.) and then modify fields:
- `set`: set field values
- `scale`: multiply field values
- `add`: add offsets to fields

### intonation
Clause-type pitch shapes keyed by punctuation (example keys: `.`, `?`, `!`, `:`, `;`, `,`)

Defaults for `.`, `,`, `?`, `!` are seeded by `applyLanguageDefaults()` unless overridden by packs.

Each clause supports percent-based parameters used by `calculatePitches()` to apply pitch paths across prehead/head/nucleus/tail:
- `preHeadStart`, `preHeadEnd`: Pitch percentages for the prehead region (before the first stressed syllable).
- `headStart`, `headEnd`: Pitch percentages for the head region (from first stress up to the nucleus).
- `headSteps`: Ordered percentages that select stepped head contours on stressed syllables (example: `[100, 85, 70, 55, 40, 25, 10, 0]`).
- `headExtendFrom`: Index in `headSteps` to clamp/extend when the head is longer than the steps list.
- `headStressEndDelta`: Delta (in percent units) applied from a stressed syllable's start to its end.
- `headUnstressedRunStartDelta`, `headUnstressedRunEndDelta`: Deltas applied over unstressed runs following a stress.
- `nucleus0Start`, `nucleus0End`: Pitch percentages for the nucleus when the clause has no tail (single-word or tail-less cases).
- `nucleusStart`, `nucleusEnd`: Pitch percentages for the nucleus when a tail exists.
- `tailStart`, `tailEnd`: Pitch percentages for the tail region (after the nucleus).

### toneContours
Tone contour definitions (tone string → list of pitch-percent points)

## Frontend rule passes settings

Recent versions of the frontend can optionally run **modular "passes"** over the token stream (after IPA parsing, and optionally after timing / pitch). These passes are meant to encode phonetic/prosodic "rules" (in the spirit of SSRS/Delta/Eloquence) without turning the core IPA engine into a single giant function.

All settings below live under `settings:` in a language YAML (for example `packs/lang/en.yaml`). Passes are **disabled by default** unless `enabled: true` is set for that pass.

### Svarabhakti (vowel echo around taps and trills)

Some language packs insert a svarabhakti vocoid — the `ᵊ` pseudo-phoneme —
around taps and trills (Spanish: intervocalic `ɾ` → `ᵊɾ`, word-final `ɾ` →
`ɾ_wf ᵊ ɾ_wf`). Phonetically this element is not an independent schwa: it is
the neighboring vowel's own gesture continuing through the rhotic, at roughly
a quarter of the nuclear vowel's length (da Silva 2024, J. Speech Sciences;
Recasens 1991/1999 for the carryover direction). Without this pass, `ᵊ`
renders at one fixed neutral quality and every /Vɾ/ word ends in the same
schwa ("far/fer/fir/for/fur" collapse to a single vowel — the #113 dig).

This pass runs **before** coarticulation, so every downstream pass sees the
inherited values. The shaped `ᵊ` is exempted from coarticulation (it *is*
transition material already).

```yaml
settings:
  # Master switch. Packs without it are bit-identical to previous releases.
  svarabhaktiInheritEnabled: true

  # Share of the donor vowel in the ᵊ blend (rest keeps ᵊ's own neutral
  # color). 0.8 ≈ "replicates the nuclear vowel" per the literature.
  svarabhaktiVowelWeight: 0.8

  # Duration multiplier on the inserted ᵊ. 0.5 moves a ~37 ms insert
  # toward the observed ~1/4-of-nuclear-vowel proportion.
  svarabhaktiDurationScale: 0.5

  # Amplitude multiplier on the ᵊ — a brief echo, not a syllable.
  svarabhaktiAmpScale: 0.85

  # Vowel-to-tap carryover: blends the TAP token's own formants toward the
  # neighboring vowel (the alveolar locus belongs in the transitions, not
  # held across the whole contact). 0 = off.
  svarabhaktiTapBlend: 0.4

  # Amplitude dip applied to tap tokens at emission time. The intensity
  # difference between the tap and its flanking vowels is the tap's
  # PRIMARY acoustic cue (Perry et al. 2023/2024) — with tap formants
  # vowel-colored, the dip carries the rhotic percept. 1.0 = no dip.
  svarabhaktiTapDip: 0.55
```

Related engine behavior (not a setting): the single-word final hold
(`singleWordFinalHoldMs`) is redirected from a word-final tap to the nearest
preceding vowel — a ~15 ms ballistic flick cannot be held, and holding it
renders a long static constriction that reads as an appended schwa syllable.

### Steady-state vowels (coarticulated vowels land on their targets)

Companion to coarticulation (see below): without it, a coartic-shaped vowel
spends its entire duration ramping onset → exit and never renders its
canonical formants (Spanish "dos" read as [ø] — issue #113). With the flag
on, vowels ≥45 ms render as onset-transition → held canonical steady state →
exit-transition, the shape reference formant synthesis and natural speech
both show.

```yaml
settings:
  coarticulationSteadyState: true
  coarticulationTransInMs: 35    # CV transition length
  coarticulationTransOutMs: 40   # VC transition length
```

### Coarticulation

The coarticulation pass makes consonants "aim" toward a vowel-dependent locus instead of snapping to a single fixed consonant target. In practice this reduces edgy segment boundaries (especially in stop clusters) while keeping consonants intelligible at high speech rates.

```yaml
settings:
  # Master switch for this pass.
  coarticulationEnabled: true

  # Overall amount of locus pull (0.0–1.0). Higher = stronger vowel influence on consonants.
  coarticulationStrength: 0.25

  # Optional scaling for word-initial consonants (often useful to keep word onsets crisp).
  coarticulationWordInitialFadeScale: 1.0

  # Cross-syllable reduction: when a consonant and its adjacent vowel are in
  # different syllables, multiply the effective coarticulation strength by this.
  # Values < 1.0 make cross-syllable transitions crisper (less vowel pull on the
  # consonant), preserving syllable identity. Default 1.0 (no reduction).
  coarticulationCrossSyllableScale: 0.70

  # ── High-rate intelligibility ──
  # At high speech rates, IIR cascade resonators spend most of their time
  # in transition rather than at target frequencies. These settings reduce
  # coarticulation strength and widen bandwidths at speed so vowels sound clearer.
  highRateThreshold: 2.5            # speed below which no attenuation (shared
                                    # with boundary smoothing fade ratio and BW widening)
  highRateCoarticulationFloor: 0.35 # minimum strength multiplier at extreme speed
                                    # (ceiling is threshold × 1.8)
  highRateBandwidthWideningFactor: 1.3
                                    # max cascade BW multiplier at extreme speed.
                                    # Wider BW = faster resonator settling = formant
                                    # identity expressed sooner in compressed frames.
                                    # 1.0 = disabled. Ramps linearly from threshold
                                    # to ceiling (threshold × 1.8). en-us uses 1.3.
```

#### Graduated coarticulation

When `coarticulationGraduated` is enabled, the vowel influence is **scaled by vowel proximity** rather than being treated as an on/off switch. Adjacent vowels get the strongest pull; the effect tapers off as you move through consonant clusters.

```yaml
settings:
  coarticulationGraduated: true
  coarticulationAdjacencyMaxConsonants: 2   # 0=only immediate neighbors, 1=allow C_V, 2=allow CC_V
```

#### Locus targets

These define the vowel-independent "anchor" targets the pass pulls toward for common places of articulation. Think of them as the baseline F2 goals for labial / alveolar / velar stops and related consonants.

```yaml
settings:
  coarticulationLabialF2Locus: 800
  coarticulationAlveolarF2Locus: 1800
  coarticulationVelarF2Locus: 1200
```

#### Context-dependent velar F2 locus (optional)

The velar place of articulation is unusual — the tongue body contact point shifts depending on the neighboring vowel. Before front vowels ("geese", "key"), velars have a high F2 locus. Before back vowels ("go", "cool"), velars have a low F2 locus. Without this split, the phoneme's static `cf2` value dominates and velars sound nearly identical to alveolars before back vowels.

```yaml
settings:
  # 0 = disabled (use phoneme cf2 as-is). When set, overrides the
  # srcF2 fed to the MITalk coarticulation equation.
  coarticulationVelarF2LocusFront: 1800   # before front vowels (vowel F2 > 1600)
  coarticulationVelarF2LocusBack: 1100    # before back vowels  (vowel F2 <= 1600)
```

This gives "go" /ɡoʊ/ a gentle F2 glide (1100→900) while "geese" /ɡiːs/ stays crisp (1800→2200). The threshold between "front" and "back" is currently hardcoded at 1600 Hz (vowel F2).

#### Velar pinch (optional)

Velars often sound more natural when F2 and F3 move closer ("pinch") near high-front vowel contexts. This option applies a controlled pinch when the adjacent vowel's F2 suggests a fronting context.

```yaml
settings:
  coarticulationVelarPinchEnabled: true

  # Only apply pinch when the neighboring vowel's F2 is at/above this threshold.
  coarticulationVelarPinchThreshold: 1800

  # Scales F2 during pinch (values < 1.0 pull it down toward the pinch band).
  coarticulationVelarPinchF2Scale: 0.9

  # Target F3 to blend toward during pinch.
  coarticulationVelarPinchF3: 2400
```

#### Per-formant scaling

Control how much each formant is affected by coarticulation:

```yaml
settings:
  coarticulationF1Scale: 0.6   # F1 gets 60% of coarticulation effect
  coarticulationF2Scale: 1.0   # F2 gets full effect (most important for place)
  coarticulationF3Scale: 0.5   # F3 gets 50% of effect
```

#### Mitalk-K locus weighting

The `coarticulationMitalkK` parameter controls how strongly consonant locus targets pull the formants vs. how strongly vowel targets pull:

```yaml
settings:
  coarticulationMitalkK: 0.42  # 0.0 = all vowel, 1.0 = all consonant locus
```

Tuning notes:
- If consonants start feeling "too vowel-y", lower `coarticulationStrength`.
- If clusters get mushy at speed, keep `coarticulationGraduated: true` and reduce `coarticulationAdjacencyMaxConsonants` to `1`.
- If word onsets lose bite, lower `coarticulationWordInitialFadeScale`.
- For language-specific coarticulation effects (e.g. rhotic F3 lowering, labial F2 pulling), use the **special coarticulation** pass instead of modifying the core locus pass.

#### Aspiration coarticulation

Post-stop aspiration tokens (the /h/-like burst after voiceless stops like /p/, /t/, /k/) inherit formants from the generic /h/ phoneme via `_copyAdjacent`. But at the boundary between the stop burst and the following vowel, the aspiration's formants should transition smoothly along the stop→vowel locus trajectory rather than jumping to generic /h/ values.

The aspiration coarticulation settings control where the aspiration's formants sit on the stop→vowel trajectory:

```yaml
settings:
  # 0.0 = stop's locus target, 1.0 = vowel's formant target.
  # The DSP ramps from blendStart to blendEnd across the aspiration token.
  coarticulationAspirationBlendStart: 0.3   # start 30% toward the vowel
  coarticulationAspirationBlendEnd: 0.7     # end 70% toward the vowel
```

This creates a smooth spectral glide through the aspiration: formants start near the stop's place of articulation and arrive close to the vowel target by the time voicing begins. Without this, aspiration can sound disconnected — a generic "huh" between stop and vowel rather than a natural release.

The aspiration blend is scaled by the main `coarticulationStrength` so it tracks with the overall coarticulation intensity. It only applies to tokens marked as `postStopAspiration` (inserted by the post-stop aspiration pass), not to phonemic /h/.

### Special coarticulation

The special coarticulation pass applies **language-specific formant Hz deltas** to vowels adjacent to trigger consonants. Unlike the core coarticulation pass (which does MITalk-style locus interpolation), this pass lets you write explicit rules like "lower F3 by 200 Hz on vowels next to /ɹ/" directly in YAML.

```yaml
settings:
  specialCoarticulation:
    enabled: true
    maxDeltaHz: 400       # safety clamp on accumulated deltas

    rules:
      - name: "rhotic F3 lowering"
        triggers: ["ɹ", "r"]
        vowelFilter: all        # "all", "front", "back", or a specific IPA key
        formant: f3
        deltaHz: -200
        side: both              # "left", "right", or "both"
        cumulative: true        # if both sides match, apply twice
        unstressedScale: 0.7    # reduce effect on unstressed vowels
        phraseFinalStressedScale: 1.2   # boost at phrase-final stress

      - name: "labial F2 pull"
        triggers: ["w"]
        vowelFilter: front
        formant: f2
        deltaHz: -120
        side: right             # only when /w/ precedes the vowel
```

Flat-key equivalents:

- `specialCoarticulationEnabled`
- `specialCoarticMaxDeltaHz`

(Rules must be defined via the nested `rules:` sequence — there are no flat-key equivalents for individual rules.)

#### Rule fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Human-readable label (for debugging) |
| `triggers` | list | IPA keys that activate the rule (e.g. `["ɹ", "r"]`) |
| `vowelFilter` | string | Which vowels to affect: `"all"`, `"front"` (F2 > 1600), `"back"` (F2 < 1400), or a specific IPA key |
| `formant` | string | Which formant to shift: `"f2"` or `"f3"` |
| `deltaHz` | number | Hz offset to apply (negative = lower) |
| `side` | string | Where to look for triggers: `"left"`, `"right"`, or `"both"` |
| `cumulative` | bool | If true and triggers match on both sides, apply the delta twice |
| `unstressedScale` | number | Multiply delta by this for unstressed vowels (default `1.0`) |
| `phraseFinalStressedScale` | number | Multiply delta by this for phrase-final stressed vowels (default `1.0`) |

Tuning notes:
- Deltas are accumulated across all matching rules and clamped to ±`maxDeltaHz`.
- The pass also adjusts `endCf2`/`endCf3` if the locus pass set end targets, so transitions stay consistent.
- Use `cumulative: true` for rhotics where vowels between two /ɹ/ should get a double dose of F3 lowering.

### Cluster timing

The cluster timing pass shortens consonants that occur in clusters (adjacent to other consonants) and adjusts word-medial/word-final obstruent durations. This prevents consonant clusters from feeling "stacked" at normal speech rates.

```yaml
settings:
  clusterTiming:
    enabled: true

    # Two-consonant cluster scales (by type pair).
    fricBeforeStopScale: 0.65       # e.g. /st/, /sp/
    stopBeforeFricScale: 0.70       # e.g. /ts/, /pf/
    fricBeforeFricScale: 0.75       # e.g. /sf/
    stopBeforeStopScale: 0.60       # e.g. /kt/, /pt/

    # Triple cluster: middle consonant gets extra shortening.
    tripleClusterMiddleScale: 0.55  # e.g. the /t/ in /str/

    # Affricates in clusters get an additional multiplier.
    affricateInClusterScale: 0.75

    # Non-cluster position adjustments.
    wordMedialConsonantScale: 0.85  # word-internal consonants not in a cluster
    wordFinalObstruentScale: 0.90   # word-final stops/fricatives/affricates
```

Flat-key equivalents are also supported:

- `clusterTimingEnabled`
- `clusterTimingFricBeforeStopScale`
- `clusterTimingStopBeforeFricScale`
- `clusterTimingFricBeforeFricScale`
- `clusterTimingStopBeforeStopScale`
- `clusterTimingTripleClusterMiddleScale`
- `clusterTimingAffricateInClusterScale`
- `clusterTimingWordMedialConsonantScale`
- `clusterTimingWordFinalObstruentScale`

How it behaves:

- Consonants are classified as stop (including affricates), fricative, or other.
- In a two-consonant cluster, both members can be scaled: the first by "X before Y" and the second by "Y after X" (but stops after fricatives are not double-scaled — the fricative absorbs the shortening).
- Triple clusters (three consecutive consonants with no syllable/word boundary between them) apply `tripleClusterMiddleScale` to the middle consonant instead of the two-consonant rules.
- Syllable and word boundaries break triple cluster detection — e.g. in "abstract" /b.str/, the /s/ starts a new onset and doesn't get the triple shortening.
- All scale factors are clamped to ≤ 1.0 (never lengthen), and the result has a 2ms floor.

Tuning notes:
- If clusters sound "crushed" at high rates, raise the scale factors closer to 1.0.
- If isolated word-final stops/fricatives sound too long, lower `wordFinalObstruentScale`.
- The affricate multiplier stacks with the cluster type scale — so an affricate in a stop+stop cluster gets `stopBeforeStopScale × affricateInClusterScale`.

### Cluster blend

The cluster blend pass adds **formant coarticulation between adjacent consonants** in clusters. Where cluster *timing* shortens consonants to prevent stacking, cluster *blend* modifies C2's start formants to anticipate C1's place of articulation — creating a smooth spectral transition instead of an abrupt frequency jump at the C1→C2 boundary.

The pass reads each consonant's formant values from `phonemes.yaml` (consonants DO have formant targets — /s/: cf2=1390, /t/: cf2=1700, /k/: cf2=1800, /n/: cf2=1550) and blends C2's onset toward C1's values.

```yaml
settings:
  clusterBlend:
    enabled: true
    strength: 0.35              # Master blend fraction (0.0–1.0)

    # Per-manner-pair scale factors (multiplied by strength).
    # Higher = more spectral blending between these consonant types.
    nasalToStopScale:   1.30    # /ŋk/, /mp/, /nt/, /nd/
    fricToStopScale:    0.85    # /st/, /sk/, /sp/
    stopToFricScale:    0.70    # /ts/, /ks/
    nasalToFricScale:   1.00    # /nf/, /ns/, /mf/
    liquidToStopScale:  0.85    # /lt/, /rk/, /lp/
    liquidToFricScale:  0.75    # /ls/, /rf/
    fricToFricScale:    0.60    # /sʃ/ (rare, morpheme boundaries)
    stopToStopScale:    0.55    # /kt/, /pt/, /gd/
    defaultPairScale:   0.50    # Anything not listed above

    # Context modifiers
    homorganicScale:    0.30    # Same place of articulation → less shift needed
    wordBoundaryScale:  0.50    # C2 starts a new word → weaker blend

    # Per-formant scaling
    f1Scale: 0.50               # F1 blend is gentler (jaw height, not place)

    # Forward drift: fill endCf on ANY token still missing it.
    # After C→C blending, consonants next to vowels still have flat formants
    # during their hold phase. Forward drift looks at the next real phoneme
    # and sets endCf to drift this fraction of the distance toward it.
    # F1 drift is scaled by f1Scale to prevent a "tight jaw" sound.
    forwardDriftStrength: 0.30  # 0.0 = disabled, 0.3 = 30% drift toward next phoneme
```

Flat-key equivalents are also supported:

- `clusterBlendEnabled`
- `clusterBlendStrength`
- `clusterBlendNasalToStopScale`
- `clusterBlendFricToStopScale`
- `clusterBlendStopToFricScale`
- `clusterBlendNasalToFricScale`
- `clusterBlendLiquidToStopScale`
- `clusterBlendLiquidToFricScale`
- `clusterBlendFricToFricScale`
- `clusterBlendStopToStopScale`
- `clusterBlendDefaultPairScale`
- `clusterBlendHomorganicScale`
- `clusterBlendWordBoundaryScale`
- `clusterBlendF1Scale`
- `clusterBlendForwardDriftStrength`

How it behaves:

- For each C1→C2 consonant pair (skipping micro-gaps and post-stop aspiration tokens between them), the pass classifies both by manner (stop, fricative, nasal, liquid) and place (labial, alveolar, palatal, velar).
- The effective blend strength = `strength × pairScale × contextModifiers`, clamped to [0, 1].
- C2's start formants (F1, F2, F3) are interpolated toward C1's values: `startF2 = c2f2 + strength × (c1f2 − c2f2)`. The original C2 values are stored as `endCf2`/`endCf3` so the DSP ramps back to the canonical target during the phoneme.
- F1 uses a reduced blend (`strength × f1Scale`) since F1 is mainly jaw height, not place.
- A minimum delta threshold of 15 Hz prevents unnecessary micro-adjustments.
- Homorganic pairs (same place) get reduced blending — they already share similar formant targets.
- Word boundaries reduce blend strength since C2 belongs to a new articulatory plan.

#### Forward drift

The C→C blending above only handles consonant clusters. But consonants adjacent to vowels also sit spectrally frozen during their hold phase — the vowels glide (thanks to coarticulation setting endCf), but consonants between them are dead walls. The ear hears glide-freeze-glide-freeze.

`forwardDriftStrength` fixes this. After the C→C loop, a second loop runs over every token that still has no endCf set. For each, it looks ahead to the next real phoneme (skipping micro-gaps and aspiration) and sets endCf to drift `forwardDriftStrength` of the distance toward the next phoneme's formants. F1 drift is multiplied by `f1Scale` to prevent jaw-height changes from making the voice sound "tight-jawed."

For example, with `forwardDriftStrength: 0.30` and `f1Scale: 0.50`:
- /b/ (cf2=900) before /ə/ (cf2=1400): endCf2 = 900 + 0.30 × (1400 − 900) = 1050. The /b/ drifts 150 Hz toward the schwa during its hold phase.
- F1 drift = 0.30 × 0.50 = 0.15 — much gentler, keeping jaw movement subtle.
- /ə/ before /n/: if coarticulation already set endCf on the vowel, forward drift skips it (only fills gaps).

This is NOT coarticulation (which computes WHERE formants should be using locus math) — it's a simple "don't freeze" mechanism that ensures formants are always moving toward the next target.

Tuning notes:
- This pass complements cluster timing (duration) and boundary smoothing (crossfade). All three work together: timing shortens, smoothing crossfades, blend shapes the spectral trajectory.
- If clusters sound "blurred" or consonants lose identity, lower `strength` or the per-pair scales.
- Nasal→stop pairs (e.g. /ŋk/, /nt/) benefit from higher blend because the nasal's formant structure naturally anticipates the stop's place.
- Stop→stop pairs use lower scales because each stop has its own burst character that shouldn't be smeared.
- If forward drift makes the voice sound "tight-jawed," lower `forwardDriftStrength` or reduce `f1Scale`. The tight-jaw effect comes from F1 being pulled toward low consonant values.
- Forward drift is subtle — it fills the hold phase, not the crossfade. The ear perceives it as "nothing is ever still" rather than a dramatic formant sweep.

### Prominence

The prominence pass has two stages: **scoring** (phonological classification) and **realization** (acoustic output). Scoring assigns each vowel a 0.0–1.0 prominence value from stress marks, vowel length, and word position. Realization uses that score to apply duration multipliers, amplitude shaping, and pitch scaling.

When prominence is enabled, it **replaces** the old `primaryStressDiv`/`secondaryStressDiv` system for stress realization. The old stressDiv path is bypassed in `calculateTimes()`, and the prominence pass applies direct duration multipliers to vowels instead. This avoids double-lengthening and gives finer control (vowel-only, not whole-syllable).

```yaml

  prominence:
    enabled: true

#### Design principles

1. **Score and realization are separate.** Scoring is phonological classification (primary=1.0, secondary=`secondaryStressLevel`, unstressed=0.0). Realization settings (`primaryStressWeight`, `secondaryStressWeight`) are direct duration multipliers applied in a later pass. This means the weight knob always does something audible — `1.4` = 40% longer, `0.8` = 20% shorter.

2. **Prominence is max-combined, not additive.** If a vowel has primary stress (1.0) AND is long (0.5), prominence = max(1.0, 0.5) = 1.0, not 1.5. Word-position adjustments are additive on top of the max (then clamped to 0.0–1.0).

3. **Replaces stressDiv when enabled.** When `prominence.enabled` is true, the old `primaryStressDiv`/`secondaryStressDiv` system is bypassed in `calculateTimes()`. All stress-based duration shaping is handled by the prominence pass (vowel-only, not whole-syllable). When `prominence.enabled` is false (default), the old stressDiv system runs exactly as before — zero change.

4. **Auto-migration.** If a pack enables prominence but doesn't set custom weight values, the engine auto-migrates from `primaryStressDiv`/`secondaryStressDiv` into the equivalent prominence weights. This prevents silent regressions when switching an existing pack to prominence mode.

5. **Diphthong-safe.** Offglide tokens (`tiedFrom`) inherit their nucleus's prominence score for amplitude treatment, but the duration floor is skipped — their short duration IS the glide.

#### How prominence interacts with stress divisors

When `prominence.enabled` is **false**: `primaryStressDiv` and `secondaryStressDiv` run as before, slowing entire syllables. Prominence has no effect.

When `prominence.enabled` is **true**: the stressDiv path is bypassed (`curSpeed = baseSpeed` for all syllables regardless of stress). Instead, the prominence pass applies `primaryStressWeight` / `secondaryStressWeight` as direct duration multipliers on vowels only. This is more precise — consonants keep their natural cluster-timing durations, and the weight knob has a direct, predictable effect (`1.4` = 40% longer stressed vowels).

#### Stress inheritance from eSpeak

eSpeak puts stress marks on syllable-initial consonants, not vowels. The prominence pass walks backward from each vowel to the syllable start to check for inherited stress, without crossing word boundaries or other vowels.

#### Duration realization details

Duration multipliers are applied based on prominence thresholds:

| Prominence | Category | Duration effect |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| >= 0.9 | Primary stress | `durationMs *= primaryStressWeight` |
| >= 0.4 | Secondary stress | `durationMs *= secondaryStressWeight` |
| < 0.3 | Unstressed | blended toward `durationReducedCeiling` |
| 0.3–0.9 gap | — | no double-application (clean threshold bands) |

The thresholds are designed so that: primary stress always scores 1.0 (even with -0.1 word-final reduction = 0.9), secondary scores ~0.6 (>= 0.4), and unstressed scores ~0.0 (< 0.3).

#### Amplitude realization details

- Prominent vowels (score >= 0.5): boost scales linearly from 0dB at 0.5 to `amplitudeBoostDb * primaryStressWeight * factor` at 1.0. The weight scaling means turning up the weight knob also makes stressed vowels louder.
- Non-prominent vowels (score < 0.3): reduction scales linearly from 0dB at 0.3 to full `amplitudeReductionDb` at 0.0. Reduction is NOT scaled by the weight — unstressed vowels get reduced regardless.
- Vowels between 0.3 and 0.5 are untouched (dead zone to avoid flutter).

#### Pitch realization details

When `pitchFromProminence` is true, the Fujisaki accent commands use prominence scores instead of raw stress marks. Any vowel with prominence > 0.05 gets an accent command with amplitude = `primaryAccentAmp * accentBoost * prominence`. This lets long vowels and word-initial vowels receive pitch peaks even without explicit stress marks.

The original stress-based accent path is preserved exactly when `pitchFromProminence` is false.

#### Syllable-position duration shaping (Pass 2b)

After prominence's main duration realization (stressed/unstressed vowel scaling), an optional second stage shapes durations based on syllable position. This creates natural rhythm: onset consonants get slightly more time (they initiate the gesture), coda consonants get less (they trail off), and unstressed open syllables compress their nucleus.

```yaml
settings:
  syllableDuration:
    enabled: true
    onsetScale: 1.10                     # onset consonants +10%
    codaScale: 0.85                      # coda consonants -15%
    unstressedOpenNucleusScale: 0.90     # unstressed open-syllable vowels -10%
```

Flat-key equivalents:

- `syllableDurationEnabled`
- `syllableDurationOnsetScale`
- `syllableDurationCodaScale`
- `syllableDurationUnstressedOpenNucleusScale`

How it behaves:

- Walks each word using the existing `syllableIndex` assignments. Monosyllabic words are skipped (no positional contrast).
- **Word-final syllables are skipped** — they're already shaped by phrase-final lengthening and `wordFinalObstruentScale`. Compressing them further makes final syllables disappear.
- For each non-final syllable, tokens are classified as onset (consonant before the nucleus vowel), nucleus (first vowel), or coda (consonant after the nucleus).
- Onset consonants get `onsetScale` (default 1.10 = 10% longer).
- Coda consonants get `codaScale` (default 0.85 = 15% shorter).
- The nucleus vowel gets `unstressedOpenNucleusScale` only if the syllable is unstressed AND open (no coda consonant) AND the vowel is not a diphthong offglide.
- Gap tokens (preStopGap, clusterGap, vowelHiatusGap, postStopAspiration, voicedClosure) are skipped.
- A 2ms floor and `fadeMs = min(fadeMs, durationMs)` clamp prevent artifacts.

**Stacking with prominence reduction:** An unstressed open-syllable vowel gets both `durationReducedCeiling` (from Pass 2) and `unstressedOpenNucleusScale` (from Pass 2b) multiplicatively. With the en-us defaults (0.92 × 0.90 = 0.83), this is intentional — these are the lightest syllables in natural speech (like /bə/ in "banana"). If vowels vanish, raise either value.

#### Pipeline position

Prominence (including syllable-position shaping) runs PostTiming, after `cluster_timing` but before `prosody`. This means cluster-adjusted consonant durations are already set before prominence looks at vowels, and phrase-final lengthening (in the prosody pass) stacks on top of prominence duration adjustments.

Tuning notes:
- **English defaults**: `primaryStressWeight: 1.4`, `secondaryStressWeight: 1.1`, `amplitudeBoostDb: 1.5`, `amplitudeReductionDb: 2.0`, `durationReducedCeiling: 0.85`. This gives stressed vowels 40% more duration + 1.5dB boost, unstressed vowels 15% shorter + 2dB quieter.
- `durationProminentFloorMs: 45` prevents stressed vowels from collapsing at high rates.
- **Hungarian**: `primaryStressWeight: 1.05` (barely any duration stress), `amplitudeBoostDb: 1.8` (stress realized through amplitude), `durationReducedCeiling: 1.0` (no unstressed reduction — syllable-timed).
- For Hungarian, `longVowelWeight: 0.5`, `longVowelMode: "unstressed-only"` — vowel length carries prosodic weight independently of stress.
- For English, `longVowelMode: "never"` is appropriate since stress is lexical, not length-based.
- The weight knob has a direct, predictable effect: `2.0` = stressed vowels twice as long, `0.5` = half as long, `1.0` = no duration stress (amplitude/pitch only).

### Syllable-aware processing

The engine assigns a `syllableIndex` to every token, enabling passes to distinguish within-syllable transitions (one articulatory gesture, should be smooth) from cross-syllable transitions (separate gestures, should be crisper). Two mechanisms work together:

1. **Syllable marking pass** (`syllable_marking`, PreTiming) — walks the token stream and converts `syllableStart` booleans into sequential `syllableIndex` integers per word. Tokens without a phoneme definition or silence tokens get index `-1`.

2. **Onset maximization** (text parser) — for words in the stress dictionary whose nucleus count matches, the text parser inserts IPA `.` syllable boundary markers at linguistically correct positions using a legal onset table loaded from the language pack. The IPA engine parses `.` and sets `syllableStart` on the next token, suppressing the heuristic consonant→vowel boundary detection for that word.

The heuristic (consonant→vowel transition = syllable start) is the fallback for words not in the stress dictionary or languages without an onset table.

#### Syllable structure configuration

The legal onset table is defined in the language pack under `syllableStructure:`:

```yaml
settings:
  syllableStructure:
    legalOnsets:
      # CC: stop + liquid/glide
      - pl
      - pɹ
      - bl
      - bɹ
      - tɹ
      - kl
      - kɹ
      - fl
      - fɹ
      - sl
      - sm
      - sn
      - sp
      - st
      - sk
      - sw
      - ʃɹ
      # CCC: s + stop + liquid/glide
      - spl
      - spɹ
      - stɹ
      - skɹ
      - skw
```

Each entry is an IPA string representing a consonant cluster that can legally begin a syllable. The onset maximization algorithm finds the longest legal onset suffix in a consonant cluster between two vowel nuclei and places the `.` boundary before it.

**Example:** "abstract" /æbstɹækt/ — the cluster between the two vowels is /bstɹ/. The longest legal onset suffix is /stɹ/ (in the table), so the boundary becomes /æb.stɹækt/. Without onset maximization, the heuristic would produce /æbstɹ.ækt/ (boundary at the consonant→vowel transition).

Languages without a `syllableStructure:` block get an empty onset table, and the text parser skips onset maximization entirely — the heuristic fallback handles everything.

#### How other passes use syllableIndex

- **Boundary smoothing:** Within-syllable transitions get gentler transition scales and longer fades (configurable via `withinSyllableScale` and `withinSyllableFadeScale`).
- **Coarticulation:** Cross-syllable consonant→vowel pairs get reduced locus pull (configurable via `coarticulationCrossSyllableScale`).
- **Cluster timing:** Triple-cluster detection respects syllable boundaries — consonants in different syllables are not treated as a single cluster.

### Boundary smoothing

#### How boundary smoothing differs from coarticulation

Coarticulation and boundary smoothing work together but answer different questions:

**Coarticulation answers: WHERE should the formants be?** It computes the actual Hz targets. When you say /ba/, the /a/ vowel doesn't start at pure /a/ formants — it starts shifted toward the labial locus because your lips are still closing from the /b/. Coarticulation calculates that shifted starting point (using MITalk locus math: `start = vowel + k * (consonantLocus - vowel)`), sets that as the frame's cf1/cf2/cf3, and puts the pure vowel target in endCf1/endCf2/endCf3. It defines the endpoints of the journey — where you start and where you're going.

**Boundary smoothing answers: HOW FAST should the formants get there?** It doesn't touch Hz values at all. It sets fade durations (how many ms the crossfade between adjacent frames takes) and transScale values (what fraction of that fade time each formant group uses to reach its target). It defines the speed and shape of the journey.

Think of it as **GPS vs driving style**. Coarticulation is the GPS — it says "you're at point A, your destination is point B." Boundary smoothing is how you drive — do you floor it and arrive in 30% of the time, or do you cruise and use the full duration? Both passes are place-aware: coarticulation picks different locus targets for labials vs velars vs palatals, and boundary smoothing picks different transition speeds to match the articulator physics.

#### What it does

Boundary smoothing increases the crossfade (fade) time at "harsh" segment boundaries (vowel→stop, stop→vowel, vowel→fricative, etc.) to reduce micro-clicks and make syllables flow together. At the same time, it sets per-formant transition scales (`transF1Scale`, `transF2Scale`, `transF3Scale`) to values **below 1.0** so that formant frequencies arrive at their target early — then hold steady while the amplitude crossfade finishes naturally. This "formants lead, amplitude follows" approach prevents the "wrong formants at full amplitude" discontinuity that can occur with longer fades.

#### Place-aware transition speeds

Transition scales are selected based on the consonant's **place of articulation**, because different articulators have different physical mass and speed:

| Place | Articulator | F1 Scale | F2 Scale | F3 Scale | Rationale |
|-------|-------------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Labial | Lips (light, fast) | 0.25 | 0.60 | 0.55 | Lips are independent of tongue — F2/F3 drift rather than snap |
| Alveolar | Tongue tip (light, precise) | 0.30 | 0.40 | 0.35 | Tip flicks fast — formants arrive quickly |
| Palatal | Tongue blade (medium) | 0.30 | 0.55 | **0.70** | F3 must linger in the low postalveolar region — F3 IS the /ʃ/ vs /s/ distinction |
| Velar | Tongue body (heavy) | 0.30 | **0.65** | 0.60 | Tongue body is the heaviest articulator — F2 transition IS the velar cue |
| Unknown | (fallback) | 0.30 | 0.50 | 0.50 | Global defaults when place can't be determined |

For C→V transitions, the consonant's place determines the speeds. For V→C transitions, the same consonant-based speeds are used but with a **40% departure slowdown** — the vowel should hold its identity longer before the consonant's influence takes over. For example, a velar V→C transition: `0.65 * 1.4 = 0.91` — nearly full fade duration, because the vowel needs to hold while the heavy tongue body begins its slow velar movement.

#### Direction and context awareness

Beyond place, the pass adjusts for transition direction and utterance position:

- **V→C departure slowdown (1.4x):** When leaving a vowel, formant transitions are 40% slower. The ear expects the vowel to hold its quality before consonant influence takes over.
- **Pre-silence vowel protection:** Utterance-final vowels (last sound before silence) skip transScale entirely. The vowel holds steady and just fades in amplitude. Without this, formants bend into silence and sound metallic (e.g. "three" where /iː/ would rush toward nowhere).
- **Utterance-final consonant gentling (1.5x):** Word-final consonants before silence get 50% gentler scales — there's no following target to rush toward.
- **V→V (hiatus):** Vowel-to-vowel transitions skip transScale entirely. Both sides are targets; no rushing.

The pre-silence lookahead skips micro-gaps (preStopGap, clusterGap, vowelHiatusGap) to find the real next token — a closure gap before a word-final stop does NOT count as "silence" for this purpose.

#### Safety guards

Two safety guards prevent the fade stretch from causing artifacts:
- **Aspiration bypass:** Tokens whose onset is aspiration-dominant (`aspirationAmplitude > 0.08`, `voiceAmplitude < 0.1` — e.g. /h/, voiceless fricatives) are skipped entirely. Aspiration needs a crisp onset; a gradual fade-in sounds mushy.
- **Voicing-flip guard:** When voicing flips between two non-vowel, non-stop consonants (e.g. /z/→/s/), the fade is not stretched. A longer crossfade would make voicing and aspiration overlap, producing buzz. Stops, vowels, and word boundaries are exempt from this guard.

```

**Within-syllable gentling:** When two adjacent tokens share the same `syllableIndex`, their transition is within a single articulatory gesture. `withinSyllableScale` multiplies the per-place transScale values (clamped to 1.0 — transitions get slower, not faster), and `withinSyllableFadeScale` multiplies the fade duration. The defaults (1.5 / 1.3) give within-syllable transitions noticeably gentler smoothing without turning cross-syllable boundaries to mush.

All settings have flat-key equivalents. You can use either the nested `boundarySmoothing:` block or flat camelCase keys — the engine reads both (nested block takes priority if both are present).

Flat-key naming convention: `boundarySmoothing` + field name in PascalCase. Examples:

- `boundarySmoothingPlosiveSpansPhone`, `boundarySmoothingNasalF1Instant`, `boundarySmoothingNasalF2F3SpansPhone`
- `boundarySmoothingVowelToStopFadeMs`, `boundarySmoothingStopToVowelFadeMs`, ... (all 13 fade times)

#### Transition coverage

The pass handles a comprehensive set of boundary types:

**Vowel transitions:** vowel→stop, stop→vowel, vowel→fricative, fricative→vowel, vowel→nasal, nasal→vowel, vowel→liquid, liquid→vowel, vowel→vowel (hiatus, but not tied diphthongs).

**Consonant cluster transitions:** nasal→stop, liquid→stop, fricative→stop, stop→fricative, nasal→fricative, fricative→nasal, stop→nasal, nasal→liquid, liquid→fricative.

**Fallback transitions:** Any consonant→consonant pair not covered above gets a generic 10ms target. Additionally, sonorant→unclassified-consonant and unclassified-consonant→sonorant transitions (e.g. /n/→/h/, where /h/ uses `aspirationAmplitude` not `fricationAmplitude` and thus `tokIsFricative()` returns false) get vowel-to-fricative-equivalent targets.

#### Fade cap and floor

The fade is capped at 75% of the token's duration to preserve some steady-state. A 6ms floor prevents the cap from creating near-discontinuities on very short sentence-final phones.

At high speech rates, the 75% cap can leave only 5-8ms of steady-state — too short for resonators to express formant peaks. The `highRateFadeRatioFloor` setting tightens the cap at speed, using the shared `highRateThreshold` (see Coarticulation section):

```yaml
settings:
  boundarySmoothing:
    highRateFadeRatioFloor: 0.40  # minimum fade ratio at extreme speed
                                  # (default 0.75 ramps down to this above threshold)
```

At 4x speed with a 25ms vowel: default allows 19ms fade / 6ms steady. With floor=0.40: 13ms fade / 12ms steady — 1-2 extra pitch cycles for vowel identity.

#### Tuning notes

**Per-place tuning by ear:**
- If velars still sound too abrupt (sharp /g/ in "dialog"): increase `velarF2Scale` toward 0.75
- If palatals lose their /ʃ/ quality ("bridge" sounds too /s/-like): increase `palatalF3Scale` toward 0.80
- If labials sound too "drifty": decrease `labialF2Scale` toward 0.50
- If alveolars sound too snappy: increase `alveolarF2Scale` toward 0.50

**General:**
- `nasalF1Instant: true` is important for natural nasal transitions — F1 jumps sharply at the velum opening/closing, overriding the place-based scale.
- Aspiration-dominant tokens (/h/, voiceless fricatives) are automatically skipped — they keep their natural crisp onset.
- If consonant-to-consonant transitions sound harsh, the generic fallback (10ms) may need tuning for your language.
- The pre-silence protection skips the nasal F1 override too — utterance-final nasalized vowels hold steady rather than snapping. This is correct behavior but worth monitoring if your language has prominent final nasal vowels (e.g. French).

**Per-parameter envelope timing:**

The source hold and voicing hold ratios create temporal structure within crossfades. Instead of all parameters blending at the same rate, each source type transitions on its own schedule:

```
Example: affricateToVowelHold=0.40, affricateToVowelVoicingHold=0.25

  0–25%:   frication=HIGH, voicing=ZERO    → pure affricate release
  25–40%:  frication=HIGH, voicing=ramping  → overlap zone (both active)
  40–100%: frication=fading, voicing=ramping → transition to vowel
```

All ratios are proportional — they scale with speech rate automatically. At rate 0 with a 10ms crossfade, 25% = 2.5ms. At rate 50 with a 5ms crossfade, 25% = 1.25ms. Both produce audible temporal separation.

- If affricates (/tʃ/, /dʒ/) sound "stringy" or disappear at high rates: increase `affricateToVowelHold` (more frication persistence) and `affricateToVowelVoicingHold` (more separation from following vowel). The en-us defaults (0.40 / 0.25) were tuned for clarity up to rate ~50.
- If stops sound too abrupt or "clicky": a small `stopToVowelVoicingHold` (0.05–0.15) gives the burst a moment to ring before voicing begins.
- Languages with short VOT (e.g. Spanish) may want lower or zero voicing hold; languages with long VOT or aspiration (e.g. English, Hindi) benefit from higher values.
- Fricatives have no voicing hold by default — they are often voiced themselves (/v/, /z/, /ð/), so delaying voicing onset would be counterproductive.

### Trajectory limiting

Trajectory limiting caps how fast key formants are allowed to move across token boundaries (best applied to **F2/F3** first). If a transition would require an extremely fast jump, the frontend spreads the change by increasing the boundary crossfade (up to `windowMs`).

```yaml
settings:
  trajectoryLimit:
    enabled: true
    applyTo: [cf1, cf2, cf3, pf2, pf3]

    # Maximum allowed change rate in Hz per ms (at speed=1.0)
    maxHzPerMs:
      cf1: 15
      cf2: 18
      cf3: 22
      pf2: 18
      pf3: 22

    # Upper cap on how much we are allowed to "spread" a change (ms at speed=1.0)
    windowMs: 25

    # If false, do not apply the limiter across word boundaries.
    applyAcrossWordBoundary: false

    # Liquids (/ɹ/, /l/) get gentler rate limits — their large formant
    # excursions are perceptually expected.  1.5 = allow 50% faster Hz/ms.
    liquidRateScale: 1.5
```

Flat-key equivalents (for use without the nested block):

- `trajectoryLimitEnabled`, `trajectoryLimitWindowMs`, `trajectoryLimitApplyAcrossWordBoundary`, `trajectoryLimitLiquidRateScale`
- `trajectoryLimitApplyTo` — comma-separated field names: `"cf1, cf2, cf3, pf2, pf3"` (brackets optional)
- `trajectoryLimitMaxHzPerMsCf2`, `trajectoryLimitMaxHzPerMsCf3`, `trajectoryLimitMaxHzPerMsPf2`, `trajectoryLimitMaxHzPerMsPf3`

Tuning notes:
- Smaller `maxHzPerMs` = smoother transitions (but too small can blur consonant identity).
- Larger `windowMs` = the limiter has more room to soften big jumps (try 30–40ms if you want fewer "corners").
- If you want the effect only inside words, keep `applyAcrossWordBoundary: false`.
- The pass is transScale-aware: it reads `transF1Scale`/`transF2Scale`/`transF3Scale` from boundary smoothing and computes the actual Hz/ms rate through the effective (compressed or expanded) fade, not the raw fade time.
- Nasals and semivowels are always exempt (sharp transitions are their perceptual identity). Liquids are rate-limited but at `liquidRateScale`× the normal limit.

### Phrase-final lengthening

Duration matters as much as pitch for prosody. Phrase-final lengthening scales the last (and optionally the penultimate) syllable/token durations near clause boundaries.

```yaml
settings:
  phraseFinalLengthening:
    enabled: true

    finalSyllableScale: 1.35
    penultimateSyllableScale: 1.12

    # Optional clause-type tuning (multipliers applied on top).
    statementScale: 1.00
    questionScale: 0.92

    # If true, apply mostly to the "nucleus" (vowel-like) portion.
    nucleusOnlyMode: true

    # Coda bias (full-syllable mode only, nucleusOnlyMode: false).
    # Stretches coda consonants more than the nucleus vowel, preserving
    # vowel clarity while giving word-final morphological segments
    # (/s/, /d/, /z/) the lengthening they need.
    # Both default to 0.0 (disabled — uses finalSyllableScale for all).
    nucleusScale: 1.0    # vowel stays near natural length
    codaScale: 1.10      # generic coda fallback (nasals, liquids)

    # Class-aware coda scaling (falls back to codaScale when 0.0).
    # Stops/affricates benefit from extra duration — the burst needs
    # room for perceptual clarity.  Fricatives already carry strong
    # noise energy; stretching them just makes them hissy.
    codaStopScale: 1.30       # stops + affricates
    codaFricativeScale: 1.0   # fricatives — no stretch
    codaNasalScale: 1.25      # nasals — gentle sustain

    # Diphthong nuclei are already long (two vowel targets);
    # giving them the same lengthening as monophthongs makes them
    # sound drawled.  Set a reduced scale for diphthong nuclei.
    # 0.0 = fall back to nucleusScale (treat same as monophthong).
    nucleusDiphthongScale: 1.08
```

Flat-key equivalents: `phraseFinalLengtheningCodaStopScale`, `phraseFinalLengtheningCodaFricativeScale`, `phraseFinalLengtheningCodaNasalScale`, `phraseFinalLengtheningNucleusDiphthongScale`.

The engine detects diphthongs via the `tiedTo` flag on the nucleus vowel (ties it to its offglide). Monophthongs get `nucleusScale`, diphthongs get `nucleusDiphthongScale`.

### Amplitude contour

Gives every voiced segment its own loudness level, an onset slope and a within-segment fall, so a clause has the amplitude structure of speech instead of a row of flat holds joined by 3–10 ms crossfades. Measured on a paragraph, the stock packs put nasals 3 dB and voiced fricatives 2 dB under the loudest vowel (every voiced class has `voiceAmplitude` 0.9); ETI-Eloquence-lineage reference renders put nasal murmur 8–10 dB down and decaying toward the closure, voiced fricatives in a V-shaped valley 15–25 dB deep, unstressed vowels 3–4 dB down, and make every boundary a 20–60 ms slope. Half the syllable-rate dynamic range is a large part of what the ear reports as "spliced" or "gritty".

Three DSP-side pieces (DSP v9) carry it: a per-class level on the frame's master gain (`outputGain`, so the DSP's voicing-keyed fricative ducks are untouched), an **onset glide** (`amplitudeOnsetMs`: voicing amplitude and master gain glide in from whatever was playing at the boundary, Klatt's piecewise-linear source interpolation — levels stepped at the crossfade read as a compressor pumping), and a **fall** (`endVoiceAmplitude`: the voicing amplitude ramps down across the segment). Runs last in PostTiming, on top of prominence. Stops, taps, trills and voiceless obstruents keep their pack amplitudes and micro-events.

```yaml
  amplitudeContourEnabled: true          # default false; on in en-us since b901
  amplitudeContourOnsetMs: 20            # glide in from the previous segment (capped at 40% of the segment)
  amplitudeContourStressedFallDb: 2      # primary-stressed vowel decays this much across itself
  amplitudeContourUnstressedFallDb: 2    # unstressed vowel fall (secondary stress = the average)
  amplitudeContourUnstressedLevelDb: -2.5  # unstressed vowel level re a primary-stressed vowel
  amplitudeContourNasalLevelDb: -2       # murmur starts near the vowel...
  amplitudeContourNasalFallDb: 7         # ...and decays toward the closure
  amplitudeContourGlideLevelDb: -2.5     # liquids and semivowels
  amplitudeContourSonorantFallDb: 2      # liquid/semivowel fall
  amplitudeContourVoicedFricLevelDb: -6  # v, ð, z, ʒ: a valley; deeper reads as a dropout before the next word
  amplitudeContourVoicedAffricateLevelDb: -6  # dʒ: level only, the burst keeps its shape
  amplitudeContourVoicelessFricLevelDb: -4    # s ʃ f θ h, tʃ: level only
  amplitudeContourStopLevelDb: -3        # stop bursts and their aspiration: level only
  amplitudeContourMinMs: 40              # falls scale down for segments shorter than this (fast rates)
  amplitudeContourDeclinationDb: 1.5     # level slopes down across the clause, like F0
  amplitudeContourFinalLevelDb: -1       # the last word sits lower still...
  amplitudeContourFinalFallDb: 3         # ...and its stressed vowel falls at least this much
  amplitudeContourMakeupDb: 0            # added to every contoured segment; leave at 0, see below
  defaultOutputGain: 2.5                 # uniform loudness compensation (see below)
```

Levels are dB offsets, falls are dB across the segment. With these values the contour takes about 4.5 dB off the integrated level, and how that is bought back matters more than any single knob. Do not buy it back with `amplitudeContourMakeupDb` or by lowering only the voiced classes: then a loudness-matching gain puts every stressed vowel 4–5 dB above where the stock packs had it, and whichever stressed word is loudest reads as "pushed forward" (ear-tested 2026-09-14; the percept migrated from word to word as each was lowered in turn). The voiceless fricative and stop levels are what make the budget honest: with the bottom of the distribution down too, the candidate's crest factor equals the stock packs' (16 dB), so a uniform `defaultOutputGain` of 2.5 (default 1.5, +4.4 dB) restores the beta 9 loudness with the peaks within 1 dB of where they were at 1x, 2x and 3x and no limiter activity — the stressed vowels land exactly where the stock packs had them, and everything else sits below. The clause shape (declination, final word) was sized under that condition; with lifted peaks it needs to be larger, with pinned peaks larger values make the final word read as too quiet. Instruments for tuning: 20 ms frame-level percentiles and per-class output levels against a reference render; see `Developers.md` § FrameEx for the DSP fields.

### Microprosody

Microprosody adds small F0 perturbations around consonant→vowel boundaries and models several natural pitch/duration effects. Six independently-gated phases:

1. **Onset F0** (backward-looking): voiceless C raises vowel start pitch; voiced obstruent lowers it.
2. **Endpoint F0** (forward-looking): voiceless C after vowel raises end pitch; voiced obstruent lowers it.
3. **Intrinsic vowel F0**: high vowels (low F1) run slightly higher F0; low vowels (high F1) run lower.
4. **Pre-voiceless shortening**: vowels before voiceless consonants are shortened (strongest duration cue in English).
5. **Voiceless coda lengthening**: voiceless consonants after voiced segments get lengthened. This is the complement to Phase 4 — when the vowel shrinks before a voiceless coda, the consonant grows to preserve syllable weight (Cho & Ladefoged 1999).
6. **Total perturbation cap**: clamps combined pitch delta so no single vowel shifts more than `maxTotalDeltaHz`.

```yaml
  # All fields are flat keys (no nested block).
  microprosodyEnabled: true
  microprosodyMinVowelMs: 25

  # Phase 1: onset (backward-looking)
  microprosodyVoicelessF0RaiseEnabled: true
  microprosodyVoicelessF0RaiseHz: 15
  microprosodyVoicelessF0RaiseEndHz: 8    # optional: separate value for vowel end (0 = same as RaiseHz)
  microprosodyVoicedF0LowerEnabled: true
  microprosodyVoicedF0LowerHz: 8
  microprosodyVoicedFricativeLowerScale: 0.6   # fricatives lower less than stops

  # Phase 2: endpoint (forward-looking)
  microprosodyFollowingF0Enabled: true
  microprosodyFollowingVoicelessRaiseHz: 10
  microprosodyFollowingVoicedLowerHz: 5

  # Phase 3: intrinsic vowel F0 (F1-based height classification)
  microprosodyIntrinsicF0Enabled: true
  microprosodyIntrinsicF0HighThreshold: 400    # F1 below = high vowel
  microprosodyIntrinsicF0LowThreshold: 600     # F1 above = low vowel
  microprosodyIntrinsicF0HighRaiseHz: 6
  microprosodyIntrinsicF0LowDropHz: 4

  # Phase 4: pre-voiceless shortening
  microprosodyPreVoicelessShortenEnabled: true
  microprosodyPreVoicelessShortenScale: 0.85
  microprosodyPreVoicelessMinMs: 25

  # Phase 5: voiceless coda lengthening
  microprosodyVoicelessCodaLengthenEnabled: true
  microprosodyVoicelessCodaLengthenScale: 1.20   # 20% longer

  # Phase 6: total perturbation cap (0 = no cap)
  microprosodyMaxTotalDeltaHz: 0
```

### Rate compensation

Rate compensation enforces configurable perceptual duration floors at high speech rates. At normal speed (1x) the pass does nothing. At high speed it prevents segments from being crushed below their audibility threshold.

Every phoneme class has its own minimum duration floor. Word-final segments get extra padding because English carries morphological information at word boundaries (plural /s/, past tense /d/, possessive /z/). An optional cluster proportion guard prevents single-segment "bulge" when one consonant in a cluster hits its floor.

```yaml
settings:
  rateCompensation:
    enabled: true
    minimumDurations:
      vowelMs: 25          # formant identity needs ~25ms
      fricativeMs: 18       # spectral identity needs noise cycles
      stopMs: 4             # already tiny — protect what's left
      nasalMs: 18           # place perception (/ɲ/ vs /n/ vs /ŋ/)
      liquidMs: 15           # /ɹ/ and /l/ need F3 transition time
      affricateMs: 12        # shorter than fricative, longer than stop
      semivowelMs: 10        # glide needs trajectory
      tapMs: 4               # quick by nature
      trillMs: 12            # needs modulation cycles
      voicedConsonantMs: 10  # catch-all voiced C
      diphthongFloorMs: 0    # merged diphthongs (endCf sweep); 0 = use vowelMs

    wordFinalBonusMs: 5      # extra floor at word end (morphology)
    floorSpeedScale: 0.0     # 0.0 = rigid floors (recommended)

    clusterProportionGuard: true
    clusterMaxRatioShift: 0.4

    schwaReduction:
      enabled: false         # rate-dependent schwa shortening
      threshold: 2.5
      scale: 0.8
```

All fields also have flat-key equivalents (e.g. `rateCompVowelFloorMs: 25`). Old `rateReductionEnabled` keys are mapped to the new system automatically for backward compatibility.

A separate universal `nasalMinDurationMs` field (default 18.0) in pack.h enforces a nasal floor in `calculateTimes` for all languages regardless of whether rate compensation is enabled. Rate compensation's `nasalMs` floor is a second layer on top.

#### Sonorant-context vowel protection

Unstressed vowels flanked by sonorants (nasals, liquids, semivowels) get masked at higher speech rates because the smooth formant transitions between sonorants hide the short vowel. For example, "animals" loses its middle syllable /ə/ between /m/ and /l/ at even moderate rates.

Two settings address this with a duration bonus and an amplitude boost:

```yaml
settings:
  rateCompensation:
    sonorantContextBonusMs: 8     # extra ms added to vowel floor

  sonorantContextAmplitudeScale: 1.15  # 1.0 = no boost
```

- **Duration bonus** (`sonorantContextBonusMs`, default `8.0`): Added to the vowel floor in rate compensation Phase 1b. Only fires for unstressed vowels (stress=0) where both the previous and next non-silence, non-synthetic tokens are sonorants. The bonus is subject to the same `floorSpeedScale` as other floors.
- **Amplitude boost** (`sonorantContextAmplitudeScale`, default `1.15`): Multiplies `voiceAmplitude` for the same context. Applied at the end of the prominence pass, after all other amplitude adjustments. Set to `1.0` to disable.

A "sonorant" is any token classified as nasal, liquid, or semivowel. The check skips silence and synthetic gap tokens (closure, aspiration, hiatus) to find the real neighbors.

This applies cross-linguistically — defaults in pack.h benefit all languages. Words like English "animals"/"mineral"/"memory", Spanish "animal"/"mínimo", Hungarian "lemondani" all benefit.

### Word-final schwa reduction

Independent of speech rate, word-final schwas can optionally be shortened. This is useful for languages like Danish, German, French, and Portuguese where unstressed final syllables are naturally reduced.

```yaml
settings:
  wordFinalSchwaReductionEnabled: true
  wordFinalSchwaScale: 0.6           # 0.0–1.0, lower = shorter
  wordFinalSchwaMinDurationMs: 8.0   # floor to avoid total silence
```

Unlike rate-dependent schwa shortening (which activates at high speeds via rate compensation), this applies at all speech rates. It runs as Phase 0 of the rate compensation pass, gated by its own bool — it executes even when `rateCompEnabled` is false.

### Anticipatory nasalization

Anticipatory nasalization partially nasalizes a vowel shortly before a nasal consonant. This is optional and language-dependent.

```yaml
settings:
  nasalization:
    anticipatory:
      enabled: false
      ms: 30
      amplitude: 0.35
      blend: 0.50
```

### Liquid dynamics

Liquid/glide tokens can have internal movement rather than a static steady-state target.

```yaml
settings:
  liquidDynamics:
    enabled: true

    lateralOnglide:
      f1Delta: -50
      f2Delta: 200
      durationPct: 0.30

    rhoticF3Dip:
      enabled: true
      f3Minimum: 1600
      dipDurationPct: 0.50

    labialGlideTransition:
      enabled: true
      startF1: 300
      startF2: 700
      transitionPct: 0.60
```

### Length contrast and gemination

For languages with phonemic length, it helps to enforce floors/ceilings and make geminates behave like closures rather than just "slightly longer consonants".

```yaml
settings:
  lengthContrast:
    enabled: true

    # Vowel duration constraints (ms, at speed=1.0).
    shortVowelCeilingMs: 80
    longVowelFloorMs: 120

    # Geminate shaping.
    geminateClosureScale: 1.80
    geminateReleaseScale: 0.90
    preGeminateVowelScale: 0.85
```

### Diphthong collapse

Diphthongs like /eɪ/, /aɪ/, /aʊ/, /oʊ/, /ɔɪ/ are stored as two separate vowel tokens in the IPA stream. Without this pass, the two tokens produce a "two-beat" artifact — two steady-state plateaus connected by a boundary-smoothing crossfade. Real diphthongs are one continuous formant sweep.

The diphthong collapse pass merges **tied** vowel pairs (where token A has `tiedTo` and token B has `tiedFrom`) into a single token. The merged token carries onset formants from A and offset formants from B. During frame emission, the merged token produces multiple micro-frames with cosine-smoothed formant waypoints, yielding a natural glide.

Tied pairs can come from two sources:
- **Manual tie-bar injection** — allophone rules that insert a Unicode tie bar (U+0361) between vowel pairs (e.g. `eɪ → e͡ɪ`).
- **`autoTieDiphthongs: true`** — the IPA engine automatically ties adjacent same-syllable vowel pairs. Only vowel+vowel sequences are tied (not semivowel+vowel, so /wɪ/ in "quick" stays separate).

```yaml
settings:
  autoTieDiphthongs: true       # auto-tie adjacent vowels in same syllable

  diphthongCollapse:
    enabled: true
    durationScale: 1.0          # global fallback (used when no pairScales match)
    pairScales:                  # per-pair duration scales (Gay 1968)
      "ɑ ɪ": 1.20               # PRICE — wide, needs full open onset + glide
      "ä ʊ": 1.15               # MOUTH — wide
      "ɔ ɪ": 1.15               # CHOICE — wide
      "e ɪ": 0.95               # FACE — narrow, fine short
      "o ʊ": 0.92               # GOAT — narrow
    durationFloorMs: 60         # minimum ms for merged token (prevents crush at high rate)
    rateCompensation: 0.15      # protect glide identity at high speech rates
    microFrameIntervalMs: 8     # base interval; pitch-scaled down at higher F0
    onsetHoldExponent: 1.4      # >1.0 lingers at onset before sweeping (pow(frac, exp))
    amplitudeDipFactor: 0.03    # midpoint amplitude dip (sin curve, 0 = none)
    onsetSettleMs: 12           # extra ms for first micro-frame to let resonator settle
```

**Settings reference:**

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch for the pass |
| `durationScale` | `1.0` | Global fallback scale factor applied to the merged onset+offglide duration when no `pairScales` entry matches. Values < 1.0 compress the glide; values > 1.0 stretch it. Set to 1.0 (neutral) when using `pairScales` for all diphthongs in the language. |
| `pairScales` | (empty) | Per-diphthong-pair duration scales (Gay 1968). Map of `"onset offset"` phoneme keys to scale factors. Wide diphthongs (/aɪ/, /aʊ/, /ɔɪ/) are intrinsically longer than narrow ones (/eɪ/, /oʊ/) because F2 rate of change is fixed — wider excursion needs proportionally more time. Keys must match the resolved phoneme keys at collapse time (after preReplacements and offglide-to-semivowel conversion). Applied unconditionally — no consonant-context gating. Falls back to `durationScale` for unmatched pairs. Example: `"ɑ ɪ": 1.20` for PRICE (en-us). |
| `durationFloorMs` | `50.0` | Minimum duration for the merged diphthong token. Prevents the glide from being crushed at high speech rates. This floor is enforced inside the collapse pass itself (not in rate compensation). |
| `rateCompensation` | `0.0` | Protects diphthong glide duration at high speech rates. After merging, the collapsed duration is multiplied by `speed^exponent`. At exponent 0.0 there is no compensation (default). At 1.0 the glide is fully rate-invariant — its duration stays constant regardless of speech rate. Many formant synthesizers (notably Eloquence) retain diphthong glide identity even at high rates; this setting replicates that behaviour. Without it, diphthongs lose their spectral sweep at high rates and sound thick. en-us uses 0.15 — just enough to preserve identity at fast rates without bloating diphthongs. |
| `microFrameIntervalMs` | `8.0` | Base interval between micro-frame waypoints. **Pitch-adaptive**: at higher F0 the interval is automatically scaled down (`interval * 100/pitch`, floored at 3ms) because fewer harmonics per formant bandwidth makes crossfade phasing more audible. At 100Hz the value is used as-is; at 200Hz it halves. The frame count is clamped to 3–10. |
| `onsetHoldExponent` | `1.4` | Exponent applied to the interpolation fraction before cosine smoothing: `pow(frac, exp)`. Values > 1.0 make the glide linger at the onset target before sweeping toward the offset. Audible range is roughly 0.1–2.0. |
| `amplitudeDipFactor` | `0.03` | Controls a small amplitude dip at the midpoint of the glide (via `sin(pi * frac)`). Mimics the natural slight weakening at the transition between vowel qualities. Set to 0 to disable. |
| `onsetSettleMs` | `0.0` | Extra milliseconds added to the first micro-frame's duration, borrowed proportionally from the remaining segments (total diphthong duration unchanged). Gives the IIR cascade resonators time to settle from the preceding consonant's formant state before the glide sweep begins. Without this, consonant-to-diphthong transitions (e.g. /dʒeɪ/ in "jay", /keɪ/ in "kay") produce a shimmery/gritty artifact because the resonator is still ringing at the consonant's frequencies when the first micro-frame starts moving. Capped at 50% of total duration. en-us uses 12ms. |

**Historical note — bandwidth widening (removed):** An earlier approach (`bandwidthWideningFactor`, removed in v3.0) tried to fix the consonant-to-glide grittiness by widening cascade bandwidths (cb1/cb2/cb3) during the sweep. The theory was that formants in motion naturally have wider bandwidths in real speech. In practice it was a bandaid for the wrong diagnosis — any value high enough to help (0.35) made diphthongs sound squishy, and the value where it sounded good (0.05–0.12) was barely doing anything. The real cause was temporal, not spectral: the resonator needed settling time, not wider bandwidths. `onsetSettleMs` addresses the actual root cause.

**Pipeline interactions:**

- **Rate compensation** runs *before* diphthong collapse, so its per-class floors don't apply to merged tokens. The collapse pass enforces its own `durationFloorMs` after merging.
- **Microprosody** (Phase 4: pre-voiceless shortening) skips diphthong glide tokens entirely. Without this, words like "eight" and "state" would have their /eɪ/ crushed before /t/. The merged token's `isDiphthongGlide` flag is checked to bypass shortening.
- **Boundary smoothing** runs *after* diphthong collapse and sees the merged token as a single segment, so consonant-to-diphthong and diphthong-to-consonant transitions use normal fade logic.

### Allophone rules

YAML-driven allophone rule engine. Replaces the older `positionalAllophones` system. See the [allophone rules reference](#allophone-rules-yaml-driven-rule-engine) earlier in this document for the full rule format.

```

### Clause-final fade
- `clauseFinalFadeMs` (number, default `0.0`): Appends a short fade-to-silence at the end of every utterance (all clause types, not just single words). This softens the hard cut at the end of sentences, particularly useful for languages/voices where stop aspiration at sentence boundaries sounds abrupt. Set to `25` for a subtle tail, or `0` (default) for the original crisp cutoff.

### Single-word tuning

When speaking isolated words or letters (e.g. spelling mode, single-word responses), the default prosody can sound abrupt or produce an odd rising "comma contour." Single-word tuning addresses this with special handling:

```yaml
settings:
  singleWordTuningEnabled: true

  # Extra hold to add to the final voiced vowel/liquid/nasal (ms at speed=1.0).
  singleWordFinalHoldMs: 45

  # Scale factor for liquid hold (R, L). Liquids can sound "pirate-y" when held
  # too long. Use 0.3–0.5 for US English to reduce the exaggerated R sound.
  singleWordFinalLiquidHoldScale: 1.0

  # Fade to silence to append after single-word utterances (ms at speed=1.0).
  singleWordFinalFadeMs: 18

  # If the caller uses clauseType ',' for continuation, use a statement contour
  # for isolated words/letters to avoid the odd "comma rise".
  singleWordClauseTypeOverride: "."
  singleWordClauseTypeOverrideCommaOnly: true
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `singleWordTuningEnabled` | `true` | Enables single-word specific prosody adjustments |
| `singleWordFinalHoldMs` | `45` | Extra hold added to the final voiced vowel/liquid/nasal (ms at speed=1.0) |
| `singleWordFinalLiquidHoldScale` | `1.0` | Scale factor for liquid (R/L) hold. Use 0.3–0.5 for US English to avoid "pirate R" |
| `singleWordFinalFadeMs` | `18` | Fade-to-silence appended after single-word utterances (ms at speed=1.0) |
| `singleWordClauseTypeOverride` | `"."` | Override clause type for isolated words/letters |
| `singleWordClauseTypeOverrideCommaOnly` | `true` | Only apply the override when caller uses clauseType `','` (avoids the odd "comma rise" on continuations) |

## How to add or tune phonemes (data.py reference + YAML packs)
`data.py` is a dictionary: keys are IPA symbols (like `a`, `ɚ`, `t͡ʃ`, `ᴒ`, etc.) and values are parameter sets that describe how the formant synthesizer should shape that sound. While the runtime path is now YAML-based, the same concepts apply. Be sure to match any tuning with the equivalent entries in `packs/phonemes.yaml`, and map usage in `packs/lang/*.yaml` so your changes are actually used.

### Adding a new phoneme (recommended workflow)
1. **Pick a key**
   - Use a real IPA symbol if possible (`ɲ`, `ʎ`, `ɨ`, …).
   - If you need a language-specific variant, use a private/internal key (we use things like `ᴒ`, `ᴇ`, `ᴀ`, `ᴐ`).
2. **Clone the closest existing phoneme**
   - Copy an existing entry and adjust it.
   - This is important: the engine expects most fields to exist. A "minimal" entry can crash.
3. **Tune it**
   - Start by adjusting formant center frequencies (`cf1`, `cf2`, `cf3`).
   - Then adjust bandwidths (`cb1`, `cb2`, `cb3`) if it sounds "boxy/ringy".
   - Only then adjust frication/aspiration settings.
4. **Wire it up in language-specific YAML**
   - Make sure `normalizeIPA()` (legacy path) or the YAML normalization rules output your new key for the right language/case.
   - If you don't map it, the phoneme will never be used.

### Parameter reference (what the fields mean)
#### Phoneme type flags (metadata)
These fields are used by timing rules and by a few special cases:
- `_isVowel`: This is a vowel (timed longer, can be lengthened with `ː`).
- `_isVoiced`: Voiced (uses `voiceAmplitude`).
- `_isStop`: Stop consonant (very short; may get a silence gap).
- `_isNasal`: Nasal consonant or nasal vowel coupling.
- `_isLiquid`: l/r-like sounds (often get longer fades).
- `_isSemivowel`: Glides like j/w (often short and transitional).
- `_isTap`, `_isTrill`: Very short rhotic types.
- `_isAfricate`: Affricate (timed like a stop+fricative).
- `_copyAdjacent`: Copy unset formant parameters from the nearest adjacent phoneme. Used for `h` and inserted post-stop aspirations so they take on the formant shape of the neighboring vowel, making them sound more natural in context.

#### Core formant synthesizer knobs
Think of a vowel as resonances (formants). The important ones are F1–F3.

**Formant center frequencies** define where the resonances are (in Hz-ish units):
- `cf1`, `cf2`, `cf3`, `cf4`, `cf5`, `cf6` — "Cascade" formant frequencies. F1–F3 matter most for vowel identity.
- `cf7`, `cf8` — Higher formant frequencies (defaults: 6500 Hz, 7500 Hz). These add presence to fricatives via parallel resonators. Per-phoneme tuning is rarely needed — natural variation is only ~60 Hz across vowels, and what matters more is scaling with vocal-tract length, which the existing F4-widening voice parameter already handles.
- `pf1`, `pf2`, `pf3`, `pf4`, `pf5`, `pf6` — "Parallel" formant frequencies. Usually matched to the `cf*` values.

Quick intuition:
- Higher `cf1` → more open mouth (e.g. "ah")
- Higher `cf2` → more front / brighter (e.g. "ee")
- Lower `cf2` → more back / rounder ("oo")
- Lower `cf3` → more "r-colored" (rhotic vowels)

**Bandwidths** define how wide each resonance is:
- `cb1..cb6`, `cb7`, `cb8`, and `pb1..pb6`

Quick intuition:
- Narrow bandwidth (small numbers) → very "ringy / boxy / hollow"
- Wider bandwidth → smoother / less resonant / less "plastic box"

If something sounds "boxy", widening `cb2`/`cb3` (and matching `pb2`/`pb3`) is often the first fix.

#### Amplitude / mixing controls
- `voiceAmplitude`: Strength of voicing. Lower it slightly if vowels feel "over-held" or harsh.
- `fricationAmplitude`: Noise level for fricatives (`s`, `ʃ`, `f`, `x`, etc.). If "s" is too hissy, reduce this.
- `aspirationAmplitude`: Breath noise used for aspirated/"h-like" behavior. Usually 0 for vowels.
- `parallelBypass`: Mix control between cascade and parallel paths. Most phonemes keep this at 0.0 unless you know you need it.
- `pa1..pa6`: Per-formant amplitude in the parallel path. Most entries keep these at 0.0. If a diphthong glide is too weak, a tiny `pa2`/`pa3` boost can help.

#### Nasal coupling (optional)
Some entries include:
- `cfN0`, `cfNP`, `cbN0`, `cbNP`, `caNP`

These relate to nasal resonance and coupling. We currently treat nasality conservatively; if you don't know what to do, clone from an existing nasal vowel/consonant entry.

#### Micro-event frame emission fields

These phoneme-level fields control the fine structure of stop bursts, fricative envelopes, and voiced closures. They live in `packs/phonemes.yaml` alongside the formant data. All default to 0.0 (engine uses built-in defaults when unset).

**Stop burst shaping:**
- `burstDurationMs` (number): Length of the burst noise in milliseconds. Longer bursts give velars their characteristic "compact" quality. Typical values: alveolar 5-7 ms, velar 10-12 ms.
- `burstDecayRate` (number, 0.0-1.0): How quickly burst energy decays. 0.0 = flat (no decay), 1.0 = instant cutoff. Velars use ~0.4 (slow decay), alveolars ~0.5.
- `burstSpectralTilt` (number): Tilts the burst spectrum. Negative values boost high-frequency energy (brighter burst). Used on velars (-0.15) for the characteristic "compact spectrum" sound. This works by modifying parallel amplitudes pa3-pa6 directly in the burst micro-frame.

**Voiced closure (voice bar):**
- `voiceBarAmplitude` (number, 0.0-1.0): Voicing level during stop closure. Higher values give a stronger murmur before the burst. Typical: 0.3 for voiced stops. Set to 0 for voiceless stops.
- `voiceBarF1` (number, Hz): F1 frequency during closure. Low values (120-180 Hz) give the characteristic "muffled" voice bar sound.

**Fricative envelope:**
- `fricAttackMs` (number): Onset ramp time for frication noise. Controls how quickly friction builds. Typical: 3 ms. Skipped in post-stop clusters (/ks/, /ts/) where the stop burst leads directly into frication.
- `fricDecayMs` (number): Offset ramp time for frication noise. Controls how gradually friction fades. Typical: 4 ms. Skipped for affricates where frication sustains through the release.

**Release and timing:**
- `releaseSpreadMs` (number): Duration of aspiration ramp-in after stop release (for tokens marked as post-stop aspiration). Typical: 4 ms.
- `durationScale` (number, default 1.0): Per-phoneme duration multiplier applied to the class-default duration for stops, affricates, and their closures. Values > 1.0 make the phoneme longer. Example: velars /k/,/ɡ/ use 1.3 (larger oral cavity needs more closure time), labials /p/,/b/ use 1.1, alveolars default to 1.0.

**Example:**
```yaml
phonemes:
  k:
    _isStop: true
    burstDurationMs: 11
    burstDecayRate: 0.4
    burstSpectralTilt: -0.15
    durationScale: 1.3
    voiceBarAmplitude: 0     # voiceless — no voice bar
    voiceBarF1: 150
  g:
    _isStop: true
    _isVoiced: true
    burstDurationMs: 11
    burstDecayRate: 0.4
    burstSpectralTilt: -0.15
    durationScale: 1.3
    voiceBarAmplitude: 0.3   # voiced — audible murmur
    voiceBarF1: 150
```

### Practical tuning tips (fast wins)
"This vowel sounds too much like another vowel"
- Adjust `cf1` and `cf2` first.
- Example: Hungarian short `a` vs long `á`: make short `a` lower `cf1` and lower `cf2` compared to `á`.

"This vowel is boxy / hollow / plastic"
- Widen `cb2`/`cb3` (and `pb2`/`pb3`) a bit.

"This sound is too sharp/hissy"
- Lower `fricationAmplitude`.

"This rhotic vowel (`ɚ`/`ɝ`) is too thick"
- Raise `cf3` slightly (less r-color) or widen `cb3`.

## Adding or tuning phonemes (recommended workflow)
1. Add or adjust a phoneme in `packs/phonemes.yaml`
   - Clone the closest phoneme and tweak it.
   - Keep type flags consistent (`_isVowel`, `_isStop`, `_isVoiced`, etc.) because timing rules rely on them.
2. Map it into use via language normalization
   - Add replacements/aliases in `packs/lang/<lang>.yaml` so the phoneme appears in the output stream.
3. Test
   - Compare a few representative words/phrases in NVDA across languages/dialects.

## Adding a new language
1. Create `packs/lang/<lang>.yaml`
2. Add any IPA normalizations needed for that language
3. Add or tune phonemes in `packs/phonemes.yaml` (or add internal phoneme keys)
4. If the language has special prosody needs:
   - start by adjusting settings (stress scaling, closure behavior)
   - only add new engine behavior if the data model truly can't express it

## Tonal languages (Chinese, Vietnamese, etc.)
Tonal languages are supported by treating tone as an optional overlay on top of the existing pitch model:
- enable `settings.tonal: true`
- define tone contours (digits or tone letters) in the language pack

This lets new tonal behavior be added mostly as YAML, while still allowing deeper future work (tone sandhi) if needed.
