"""TGSpeechBox — One-time config migration from nvSpeechPlayer.

When the synth driver was renamed from nvSpeechPlayer to tgSpeechBox,
the NVDA config section changed from [[nvSpeechPlayer]] to [[tgSpeechBox]].
This module copies all saved settings (voice, pitch, rate, 50+ custom keys)
so users don't lose their configuration on upgrade.

The migration runs once: if [[tgSpeechBox]] already has saved data, it's a no-op.
After copying, a deferred message box tells the user what happened.

IMPORTANT — NVDA config caveat:
    config.conf["speech"] is an AggregatedSection whose ``__contains__``
    resolves against the config *spec* (``__many__``), not just saved data.
    This means ``"tgSpeechBox" in config.conf["speech"]`` is ALWAYS True
    for any valid synth name, even if no settings have ever been saved.
    We therefore use ``.isSet()`` which checks actual profile data only.
